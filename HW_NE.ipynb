      "i ordered this because the galaxy_note 10.1 product says that it don't come in the box but it did so this was an extra.however i decided to keep it it is a great quality product the cord is the same length as what you get with your orginal tablet package.great delivery time and can't complain great product if you need an extra cord\n",
      "as other reviewers have observed this unit didn't work on my galaxy_note 10.1 rather than charge it discharged i tried a variety of usb cables on this charger unit and the unit that came with my tablet the cables all worked with the original samsung charger unit none of them worked with this charger if you buy it make sure you test it asdap and return it if it doesn't work\n",
      "the galaxy_note 10.1 requires quite a bit of charging power and this does that job well where as the charger for my galaxy_s3 doesn't.i just wish the cord to the tablet was longer i bought a 2nd charger and cable to use in the car.so far no problems i have an ac converter in my car so the charger does a good job\n",
      "we have two galaxy_note 10.1 tablets in my household and can never seem to find a charger even though each came with it's own between travel and home one charger each is not enough.first i tried an some off brands for about 6 each they failed miserably you would have to plug and unplug them over and over again for the tablet to finally accept the charge we would get the red x over the charging icon then we tried just charging them in the car when we couldn't find an ac adapter haven't had any issues with the red x when i use an auto charger even one that isn't made for the tablet this worked but didn't last long  it was a real pain in the buns...then we went looking at the charger that is specific to the note 10.1 the note 10.1 tablet isn't as common and is a newer model so there are no good deals they end up being 40 or 50.so i did a lot of research and found that this charger will work with the note 10.1 even though it was made for the tab version then i found this item listed on amazon the price was right and the charger is excellent i've had no issues with any of them and i've bought three downside is always cord length but that's samsung's fault since they decided to make the cable so short.love this deal  i really feel like i'm getting what i need and getting my  worth\n",
      "i needed a second charger for my galaxy_note 10.1 and found this one it is a great price and works perfectly i would suggest to anyone that is looking for a secondary charger\n",
      "it works as expected i can connect it to my samsung galaxy_note smothly in order to charge it or lace it to my computer i can feel the good quality of the materials besides i can use the charger to connect other usb products thanks\n",
      "the good news amazon refunded me almost instantaneously the bad news it just stopped charging and now i am without my travel spare i have always wondered if these are truly oem products if not purchased from samsung directly for these types of accessories with that said what i received looked like my original that came with my galaxy_note 10.1 and while it worked briefly seemed to be an equal.what i have noticed over time is that the sellers appear to keep changing for this product from when i first looked into buying one later figuring if there was any warranty recourse etc.to now trying to get another one i got motivated to write this review after seeing now another seller's name listed maybe i just got the bum product and all these sellers are selling oem products but i own many samsung products and they all seem quite reliable needless to say i am either buying my spare direct from samsung or buy something else sold directly by amazon\n",
      "item title may say it's ok for galaxy_note 10.1 but the amps are a little high the charger that came with my note is 5v/2.0 amps so i wouldn't want to us a charger that outputs 2.1 amps i hope someone will make a note charger replacement\n",
      "needed a second charger for my galaxy_note 10.1 works perfectly only issue with it is that samsung has unfortunately decided to use 3ft usb/30pin cables instead of a 6ft cable in other words its a short cable.works great though if you need additional chargers for your galaxy_note 10.1 this will do the trick\n",
      "i bought this to use at work to charge my galaxy_note 10.1 so that i did not have to carry my charger back and forth this might say that it is a 2a charger but it charges at about half the speed as the factory one that came with my device it is a smaller charger size wise compared to the factory one that i have it takes about 3 1/2 to 4 hours to charge from 75 to 100 while the device is powered off if i use the factory brick it only takes about 1 to 1 1/2 hours to charge the same amount.if you want a charger that you can plug in and come back several hours later or overnight this is your charger\n",
      "galaxy_note 10.1 works perfect as a secondary supply unit received was brand new in vendor sealed packaging and is identical to the one i received with my original purchased tablet\n",
      "the charger is not identical to the original but close the problem is it doesn't work at all my samsung galaxy_note 10.1 does nothing the local box store doesn't carry the charger so companies like this feed on us because we don't have a choice but to buy it from them.purchased from hesy's shopping i'd avoid them if i were you amazon needs to stop this kind of second sellers or their name will lose respect.do not buy this item from the store listed above.update tested this charger on coworkers samsung galaxy_tab 2 and it didn't work either\n",
      "below is a review of several tablets i tried in my chronological sequence with them with explanations of why i rejected all but the samsung galaxy 2 10.1 tablet i am placing the same review under each model i tried.background  i am now 65  not a member of the electronic generation i love playing scrabble and thought intensive games in general i know very little about smart phones or tablets i firmly believe that a company owes support to their consumers and not at additional cost customer service is very important to me before anyone accuses me of bias i have no connection to any of the companies mentioned i am simply a consumer relating my personal experiences!ipad  first generation  everything you do with it is tied to itunes when i tried it there was absolutely no manual or documentation available for itunes beyond the first 90 days apple wants to charge for tech support i found itunes and the apple os to be confusing and difficult to use the tablet itself performed well but i prefer an os that allows direct folder and file access.samsung galaxy 7 inch tablet first generation this device runs android 2.3 it is now several years old and still functions perfectly the battery still holds an all day charge with moderate usage i have never found an app that is incompatible with this model this is an important point in the reviews that follow i even used it to shoot surprisingly excellent videos of a music/dance presentation in a dimly lit auditorium now several years later with cataracts growing in both eyes as well as floaters in both eyes i was seeking a screen larger than the 7 inch.motorola xoom 10.1 tablet it is heavy while it worked well for reasons unknown to me it was not compatible with several of my favorite apps furthermore the screen seems to get greasy very quickly!asus tf300 transformer 10.1 inch tablet while the construction of mine was solid all the other negative observations of other reviewers were immediately apparent the tablet would not maintain wi-fi contact even close to my router the asus tf300 was also incompatible with many of my favorite apps finally the asus tf300 and tf700 mentioned below has a strange auto-spelling correct system that frequently screwed up my typing to their credit asus did answer my question with instructions on how to turn the spelling correction off but only via email they have no telephone tech support.samsung galaxy_note 10.1 inch tablet while it offers a pull out writing stylus and a rear facing autofocus camera i saw little difference between it and the samsung galaxy 2 10.1 table discussed below at roughly 200 more than the samsung galaxy 2 10.1 tablet although it performed well i did not feel it was worth the difference in price.asus tf700 transformer infinity  suffers many of the same problems as the less expensive tf300 model spastic os intermittent wi-fi disconnection the auto-brightness control also appeared not to work or not to work properly perhaps worst of all possibly because of the increased resolution the improved resolution was not apparent to my eyes  it appeared to me about the same as all the other tablets the device is incompatible with many apps!samsung galaxy 2 10.1 tablet it performed as well as my first generation samsung galaxy 7 inch tablet until i tried to download the quickmark app to scan bar and qr codes according to the app developer the app is incompatible with the tablet because the tablet does not have an autofocus rear facing camera a phone call to samsung tech support and yes  samsung believes in customer support at no extra charge confirmed the absence of autofocus in the rear facing camera since i do not carry the tablet with me when i go shopping and am not likely to scan bar or qr codes often i felt i could live without the autofocus rear camera however i did find a different qr code app that does work on the tablet i have now had the tablet for a week and am loving it so far i have not found any incompatible apps other than quickmark i find the screen to be bright and sharp auto brightness works well and the contrast to be superb i have used it to watch big bang theory via the tbs app the samsung galaxy 2 10.1 inch tablet maintains strong wi-fi connection both anywhere in my home and at the school where i attend classes other than the lack of autofocus in the rear camera and the lack of direct usb connectivity without their proprietary cable sadly this lack of standardization is still common amongst tablet manufacturers i have absolutely no complaints at this time.if you do not need or can live without a rear camera that autofocuses it does have a rear camera and a front camera for skype and other functions i highly recommend the samsung galaxy 2 10.1 tablet at the current price of 300 for the wi-fi 16gb model memory is expandable through a micro sd card i see no need for a 32gb model it is very reasonable i think there are also cell phone service compatible models at additional cost.advice to tablet shoppers:1  buy from a source that allows easy returns without restocking fees amazon is excellent for their customer service but you may want to buy from a local store to avoid shipping time and costs buy from a source that does not charge a restocking fee and allows a reasonable time for device trial.2  download as many apps that are free and that look appealing to you try each one at least briefly note any apps that are not compatible with the tablet you are testing how important are they to you?3  look at each screen under bright and dim lighting how do you find the brightness usually adjustable if auto-brightness does not work well for you the contrast the sharpness?4  log into your email account and/or create a gmail account type an email to someone does the auto spelling correct work well for you is the virtual keyboard suited to your style and needs?5  play with the tablet for a whole day if you can afford the luxury of sitting with it on see how long the battery lasts\n",
      "makes up for the lack of ports on my galaxy_note 10.1 great to view photos fresh from the camera larger than the lcd camera screen also the usb is good to access files/photos without needing a computer\n",
      "if you buy a samsung galaxy_note tablet you need this adapter set this allows you to have a usb port and a card reader slot neither of which come built in on the tablet why samsung or almost every other manufacturer for that matter do not include a built in usb port and card reader is beyond me those tablets are out there but they do not hold a candle to the samsung\n",
      "it's just the right complement for my samsung galaxy_note 10.1 very recommendable for everyone and practical especially for those who likes tablets\n",
      "i love the product but i am having a hard time finding a way to actually use it i have a galaxy_note 10.1 i know this is mostly user error but i don't have any guide included in the packaging to use it on my tablet.it took a while but i figured out how to use it i havent found a way to find it in the file manager but the pictures and videos come up in the gallery when i plug it in to my phone/camera/sd card/ect\n",
      "i searched for samsung galaxy_note 10.1 2014 and this item returned in the search i thought the connection was a micro usb connection but alas it was not this is not compatible with samsung galaxy_note 10.1 2014 my purchase and shipping cost was returned so hats off to the company\n",
      "won't work with the galaxy_note 10.1 contrary to some postings i saw about it i assume it works fine with the tab\n",
      "too bad it doesn't fit my galaxy_note 10.1 i did a search for 10.1 accessories and this was displayed\n",
      "this is a great piece if you have a galaxy_note now i can load things into my tablet with the usb port\n",
      "i purchased the samsung epl-1pl0begxar usb conversion kit as an accessory for my samsung galaxy_note 10.1 tablet model gt-n8013 this usb adapter does exactly what it claims to do when connected to the tablet it provides a host usb port for a usb flash drive up to 32 gb with a fat32 format only or a digital camera having a real usb port allows you to copy files between the tablet and a flash drive or camera without the need to have a computer present the amazon price is also considerably lower than buying directly from samsung which makes this accessory even easier to own\n",
      "i've used this for a while now on my galaxy_note 10.1 and it works fine i would recommend it\n",
      "totally works with my galaxy_note 10.1 plus my tablet has this great recognition software that lets me know i plugged a flash drive in and opens the file manager right to the removable disk drive it works so well i prefer to transfer files from this device with a flash drive than to use any other method the only thing i'm not fond of is the rigidness of it i would like it more if it had a cord between the usb and the tablet connectors so there isn't this 4&#34 of rigidity that i'm afraid to bump otherwise perfect i couldn't be happier with the functionality of it i tried another connection made for the galaxy_tab like i described above but it didn't work at all\n",
      "i ordered this usb convertor for my new samsung galaxy_note 10.1 it works great and looks very cool.the connector fits perfectly\n",
      "this works great with my samsung galaxy_note 10.1 much easier and quicker for transferring files from pc to tablet than using the kies software or unmounting sic the microsd and putting it in a usb adapter etc.i would recommend\n",
      "i love my samsung galaxy_note 10.1 tablet but like most tablets it doesn't have a usb port there are occasional times that i want to transfer something without using wireless this allows me to plug it into the charging port and instantly i have a usb port i can access file folders on either device and manage content easily.i've had no trouble so far and although i don't use it often i like having the adaptability\n",
      "i'm using this samsung brand connector to allow plugging a usb thumb drive into my galaxy_note 10.1 tablet it costs more than some of the other brand devices out there but this seems to be a solid well-made adapter where the others seem to have frequent quality problems\n",
      "this kit works for the tablets quite good for connectivity however the design of it doesn't allow for you to use a case and have this along with a flash drive plugged in e.g 10 galaxy_note tab 2 shorter adapater or cable better in this case\n",
      "this will not work for the galaxy_note 10.1 beware if that's what you're looking for probably works fine with the tab 10.1\n",
      "this was quite functional easy to use and extremely high-quality build caps lock light for when the caps lock key is pressed its got a lock button to lock/unl8ck your device easily the keys are just about perfectly spaced to be used to type fast much faster and easier than the on-screen keyboards loved this because you can use the button on the keyboard to also open up the notifications area without pressing the screen either basically a complete perfect addition and must have for your tablet devices i was soooo hoping it would fit my new galaxy_note 10.1 but it is millimeters off in total length where the tablet horizontally rests otherwise i would have kept it only drawback was sometimes while typing fast the device would repeat a keystroke over and over until another button was pressed but this only happened somewhat rarely but it could have been a connection issue definitely highly recommend\n",
      "it does not work with the new galaxy_note 10.1 or galaxy_tab 2 10.1 even it appears when you type the tags keyboard and galaxy_note 10.1 in amazon search this item is only for galaxy_tab 10.1 the very first version of the tab the other ones are wider and won't fit on this keyboard\n",
      "good keyboard but i purchased this by mistake i did a search for the galaxy_note 10.1 accessories and this keyboard shows up it will not work with the note 10.1\n",
      "reviews made it sound like it also fit the galaxy_note it does not the company said i should modify it myself\n",
      "this device felt and looked good it was listed for the galaxy_tab 10.1 i had a galaxy_note 10.1 this did not fit i a bit frustrated took tools to groove out the edge to get my tablet to fit if you have a case/cover for your tablet this of course would not be very useful i like most tablet users take their tablets with them if you keep yours at home and don't use a case and is a tab not note then this would be a very good tool to watch videos or to use to stream videos to an external device\n",
      "not quite wide enough to slip a samsung galaxy_note 10.1 tablet into but if you open the ends on both sides it will fit and does charge the device as well as cradle it\n",
      "i was very cautious before i bought this item due to all of the bad reviews i ended up taking a chance and it worked i have a samsung galaxy_note 10.1 and my girlfriend has a samsung galaxy_tab 2 10.1 and this device works with both\n",
      "pros:exynos 4210 chip is able to play high profile h.264same kind of screen and glass as my galaxy_tab 10.13.2 out of the boxtouchwiz update out of the box might be a con)microsd card reader 10.1 and 8.9 did not have this)cons:screen resolution is only 1024x600 same as kindle fire nook color nook tablet viewsonic g tablet)aggravating 30pin charger/pc link cable think apple but without the hipster but same annoyance)7 7 plus 7.7 8.9 10.1 galaxy_note 5.2 splits the market for samsung tablets and so splits up developer efforts on xdathoughts:the exynos 4210 soc is the only chip on the market that can play high profile h.264 using full hardware acceleration and this is the main reason i bought this tablet.if you have a tegra 2 tablet then you will have run into the issue where it cannot easily play high profile h.264 without overclocking and using dice player 4.70 on market this tablet has no such problems and is able to play any 720p and non high profile h.264 1080p using either the stock video player or mx player 0.00 on market which can also support embedded subtitles.i also tried the barnes and noble nook tablet which uses the texas instruments omap 4430 soc video playback is nearly as smooth using mx player so if you cannot pony up for the 7 plus then it a good alternative at 250$.if you are willing to wait then i suggest you wait for the 7.7 as it has the same specs except it has a 1280x800 screen resolution.if you live near a microcenter note that they are selling it at 350 tax so if your microcenter like mine has 3.5 sales tax then it is a very good time to buy one 11/27/2011\n",
      "i am a gadget junkie and i have owned many different products i am by no means an apple junkie but do believe they have very solid and beautiful and over priced merchandise when i purchased my first gen ipad i couldn't wait to open the box and start playing with it i quickly found it was pretty much a large copy of my iphone within a few hours i had figured out its limitations and boundaries.when i saw the samsung galaxy_tab 8.9 release i had to get my hands on it it looked so promising and exciting i could have gotten the 10 inch for cheap but i was just craving the 8.9 inch so i took the plunge wow big mistake.when i got the box i was so excited to get into this whole new system at first the galaxy_tab felt like it had so much potential i quickly found that it was very buggy being able to customize the screen with mail facebook weather and so much more was a really neat concept but the internals of the tab couldn't handle to much on the desktop at once without bad lag.while i liked the freedom the tab provided i found myself going back to my ipad just because the interface was that much smoother its been a while since i owned this unit so specifics escape my mind but i can honestly say i was not in the least bit sad to unload the tablet on e-bay.i have owned a few other samsung products the most recent being the galaxy_note i got that before it was released in the us and i can honestly say that samsung makes stellar products that are right on par with apple but the galazy tab was just not there.today i ordered a samsung series 7 slate and i have some really high hopes for this new device i know samsung has the capacity to make solid devices and i am hoping i have found my dream machine.please feel free to ask questions i know how hard it is to make your mind up on new products so i am always willing to be of any help i can!****update did not keep samsung series 7 slate windows 7 was brutal on this device and the overall quality and functionality did not match the hefty price tag while writing with the pen was a wonderfully smooth and very cool feature the rest of the slate and its features severely lacked not the dream machine i was hoping for\n",
      "this works really nicely with my samsung galaxy_note 10.1 i had trouble at first but soon realized i needed to have it also plugged into the wall outlet the picture on my large screen tv is very good and i am very happy with this product\n",
      "i can now connect my samsung galaxy_note 10.1 to my hdtv and i love it this adapter works perfectly and arrived on time and in great condition my family and i have had so much fun viewing things on the big screen instead of only on my tablet so i'm absolutely satisfied with this purchase\n",
      "if you have a samsung tablet and you have a hd tv well this is exactly what you need by the way it fits galaxy_note 10.1 because it doesn't say in the description but i have a galaxy_note 10.1 and works perfectly and in gives a very nice picture quality on my hd tv\n",

      "samsung tablets have no options when connecting to a hdtv that being said you just plug this adapter into an hdmi cable and your tablet plus you need the tablet's charging cable and that's it.you can't change the resolution if your tv has a different aspect ratio but it looks very nice the galaxy_note 10.1 in particular can output a full 1920x1080 it leaves small black bars on the top and bottom of my tv because of the aspect ratio difference outputs directly what is on your screen i found a slight 34;skipping&#34;/lagging while playing games movies run very fluidly however.all-in-all it is very easy to use and works great i recommend waiting until it is on sale to buy it because it occasionally does go on sale\n",
      "recently purchased a galaxy_note 10.1 and liking it so much i wanted a pen with an eraser end as i had seen in the note 10.1 videos.this wacom based samsung stylus works great it's the same size as a real pen and just feels like a better stylus tool for my note 10.1 than the standard s pen it also seems a little bit more responsive than the s pen i did notice that the pointer position is just ever so slightly off though about 1 mm but it's easily and naturally correctable the eraser end works fine completing the writing/drawing tool experience i wanted from this stylus.it comes with 5 extra plastic nibs keep in mind they are larger than than the note 10.1 s pen nibs and all of them are the plastic type this works for me since i put on a screen protector that added a small amount of friction with the plastic nibs the stylus glides across it as the s pen did with a rubber nib before the protector.for note 10.1 owners who buy this if you store your s pen in the tablet's slot be sure that in the pen settings you disable the feature that monitors if the s pen is stored or not otherwise this stylus will not respond.unfortunately samsung has dropped the ball so far on accessories for the galaxy_note 10.1 and their website doesn't mention this stylus works rest assured though it works just fine\n",
      "i got this for my galaxy_note 10.1 it works great as does the eraser it came with 5 replacement tips and it's 5 and one half inches long'.it is all black with a pocket clip and the button does the same as the smaller factory smart pen i like using this much better than the smaller one fits my hand much better kind of expensive but if i lose it i will replace it\n",
      "great buy takes the already great galaxy_note and makes it better by added more features and a higher response rate\n",
      "i was encountering the issues that are so currently prevalent with the sandisk uhs microsd cards in my samsung galaxy_note 2 as well as my acer iconia a500 tablet i replaced them with this samsung card and all my problems disappeared but the fast performance was still there\n",

      "i bought this tablet for my husband as it is the first one he has owned  i have a samsung galaxy_note ll 10.1 and i love it i really wanted to get a 7 inch tablet for myself but my budget wouldn't allow that so i purchased the samsung galaxy 27.0 for my husband i was hoping he would get bored with the tablet and i would get to use it when i travel no he loves it i haven't used it much myself but it responds well an is very similar to the tab 2 10.1 just smaller i love my sg note ll 10.1 tablet but i have put in a request for xmas i have a asus for my laptop and love it so while looking for a tablet for my husband i checked out their tablet asus has a great warranty and tech support but the price is way too much for their tablet  asus products are available but still a newer company you can thank asus for the nexus tablet i give the samsung galaxy 27.0 tablet 5 stars for price function and the ease of traveling with it now i just need to get one for myself as my plan to get my husbands tablet failed he loves it and after 30 yrs of marriage  i'm certain that i'll be getting one for xmas can't beat this tablet for the price\n",
      "i have the new ipad aka the ipad 3 and my mom has the kindle fire so i have used that as well i would have to say that overall the galaxy_tab 2 has worked great i received it about three days ago and i really like it i like my ipad but i always thought it was a little too big i liked the size of the fire but i felt that the operating system on it was too limited i decided the galaxy_tab 2 7 looked right for the price it's 50 more expensive than the fire and 450 cheaper than my 64gb ipad 3 the screen is not as clear or bright as the ipad 3 and the video quality isn't as good as the kindle fire but i would say that it is not too bad don't expect excellent video quality because it's not but you can't expect all the bells and whistles of a high end tablet for only 250 i like the android ice cream sandwich os it looks nice on this device and it's a lot different than amazon's version of android os on the kindle fire the interface is fairly smooth and intuitive i haven't really had much delay when tapping on icons or sliding the screen it's not quite as smooth and sensitive as the ipad but let's face it if you are interested in buying the galaxy_tab 2 7 it is probably for the price and you have ruled out the ipad for that reason or because maybe you have one already i think the camera isn't too bad considering the kindle fire doesn't even have one it is front and back there is 8gb of internal memory with an expandable slot for up to 32gb micro sd card that is a plus over the fire i find it easy to put music and movies onto the micro sd card then put the card in the galaxy_tab and it very quickly loads all of it onto the device to play easier than using the itunes software if you ask me the speakers on the galaxy_tab are not as clear and crisp or even as loud as the ipad 3 but it gets loud enough for my taste the sound is better and louder with headphones with headphones it sounds pretty good the galaxy_tab 2 is more portable than the ipad because if you don't carry a bag of some sort to put it in you can still fit it in your front pocket you wont be able to put much else in that pocket and it sticks out but you certainly can't do that with the ipad as far as android play store i am new to it i'm used to itunes but there are many of the same apps available on the play store there is a kindle app so you can still read your ebooks as far as i can tell there is no way to play amazon vod for prime members or otherwise you also can't really sync your itunes purchases to the galaxy_tab 2 either there are work arounds that allow you to put itunes movies and music on the tab but if that is something that interests you you can always look that up surfing the web is easy and you can use firefox or opera if you want i have read some reviews that say surfing the web on this tablet is slow but i have no found that to be the case web pages don't load quite as fast as the ipad but they load pretty quickly i also read reviews about how the wifi connection isn't as strong on this device as it is on other tablets that appears to be the case but it really hasn't resulted in slow internet speeds for me and my internet provider doesn't provide me with very good upload and download speeds overall for the price i would say this is a good tablet you can get a few cellphones like the samsung galaxy_note or the upcoming siii for 200-$250 that are like this tablet but with better specs however that is the price you pay if you have an upgrade available otherwise without an upgrade you will pay retail of 500-$550 i think that even the galaxy_note's 5.3 screen is a bit too small for a tablet though the 7 screen is just right for an extra-portable tablet i would recommend the galaxy_tab 2 7 you can wait until july when supposedly a 7 google asus tablet will be released for 200 it is supposed to have better specs just fyi\n",
      "pros:cheapcons:1 slow performance overall2 un-responsive touch screen3 terrible graphics and un-readable text4 horrible wifi connection and weak receivers5 even my kid doesn't want it when i wanted to gift it to him you get what you pay for its terrible and too late for me to return it.if you have to have a samsung galaxy  get the galaxy_note instead\n",
      "i will not comment on the specifications of the tablet as they are easy to find all over the internet i love gadgets and this is my third galaxy_tab my first two were 3g and since i have the galaxy_note 2 now as a phone i went for this wifi version i really wanted an ereader but this is not only my ereader but so much more i cannot see buying a kindle or nook when you can have both the kindle and nook apps on the tablet and also download other ereader apps it is a great tool for reading internet pages watching films while traveling and sometimes replaces my computer for short trips where i really just do not need the power of my laptop the price has come down so much that this for me is great tool\n",
      "this is a great little tablet especially for the price you can't beat it very functional and user friendly i bought two of them for my son's who are 8 and 10 and they absolutely love them i am a huge fan of samsung i have the galaxy_note 2 phone and note 10.1 tablet myself they are very fast and have great quality products the functionality of it is great it does everything a larger tablet can do plus you have access to the play store which i love i would highly recommend buying a memory card to go with it because 8gb does not take you very far i got my kids a 16gb myself but it is expandable up to 32gb\n",
      "like the nexus 7 this seems to have me a bit undecided on whether this or the nexus 7 makes the best 7 inch tablet for android this falls behind the nexus in specs but makes up for it in other features like touchwiz the ir remote and expandable memory the one major drawback for me is that this particular model is limted to the 8gb memory capacity with the exception of the student addition which i can't find anywhere anymore but even that's limited at 16 gb something like this i feel should be at a minimum of 16 gb with an option for 32 gb if it was a 32gb one i'd choose this one in a heartbeat over the nexus 7 but because it's lacking that memory it's a toss up between this and the nexus 7.to give a little bit more background information:i started off with a galaxy_note 10.1 tablet and loved it so much that i wanted another samsung tablet that was smaller in size for portability i figured that besides specs the only way the tab 2 would fall behind its big brother the note 10.1 would be that it lacks the s-pen so i bought it sadly i paid like 200 or 250 and a month or so later i saw the price for this model drop to about 149 when i got the device i saw that it performed much slower than the note 10.1 which was expected however it was still a sweet device with the ability to use front and rear cameras edit documents enjoy the android app store google play and so forth.but with my usage pictures movies video games apps it filled up too fast of the 8gb i think you only get to use 5 or 4 and a half so you're pretty much restricted to space if you're using it just for things like email streaming video youtube netflix hulu etc and for surfing the web with the occasional app or game download then this should be perfect but if you're going to use it for all those functions in addition to things like downloading games esp the high memory games apps and so forth then you might want to look elsewhere for a device with more memory.while you can use the micro sd card with this device it does not allow you to transfer apps to it as older android phones and tablets would let you but you can still transfer documents pdf files songs and stored videos to the card to lighten the load on the device that helps out tremendously especially if you have enough songs to take up a gig of storage videos to take up the same amount of space and a bunch of documents like textbooks for school but you still have to limit your app selection to just a couple of games if they're big ones and apps.ultimately i found it a very useful device but the storage limitations had me look elsewhere for a 7 inch device i settled on the nexus 7 32 gb and with better specs but lacking samsung's lovely touchwiz that makes using the device such a pleasant experience as for the tab 2 i didn't return it i felt it was still a great device so now i downloaded an app designed for parents to customize the user experience on it that way my son can play his games and watch his videos and read his books on it when we're traveling or at the doctor's office etc it still sees a lot of use just not by me.i would definitely recommend this tablet but would also advise people to be cautious of memory usage many people don't need that much memory and can be fine with a couple of games or a few heavy apps and use it without any problems it definitely beats most of the competition with the exception of its main rival the nexus 7 it wins out over the kindle fire hd easily which i also own and the nook tablet which i sold due to the lack of apps available for it keep in mind this review is coming from someone who likes to download apps for all sorts of things games checkbook word processors photo editing etc so this is why it gets a more negative review than others might give it for the price however i'd easily say this is one of the best choices out there and still recommend it for those looking for a great tablet at an affordable price almost unbeatable price depending on where/when you buy it\n",
      "edit 03/16/2013)having owned this tab for almost a year now i thought i would offer an update basically i still think the galaxy_tab 2 7.0 is a fantastic tablet at current price of 179 it is an amazing value sure you can get generics for 100 less but they wind up being a bit of a crap shoot i have tried a couple i always wind up frustrated because things just don't seem to work they way they should and it is often difficult or impossible to get firmware/software updates then when you do the update process can be complex and scary samsung has been very good about updates we even got jelly bean a month or so ago the update process is dead simple you get a notification an update is available then it is delivered wirelessly whenever you are ready other than making sure you have a good battery charge before starting you don't have to do anything special to update.i do not use any of the samsung apps like music hub etc it would be nice to be able to uninstall them to free up the space but that is a minor quibble.another minor quibble is the proprietary dock connector i would prefer a standard micro usb port like my galaxy_note phone oh well at least there are relatively inexpensive adapters to allow the use of usb devices.one caveat the tab 2 7.0 does not have hdmi video out capability or any other video out that i can tell period there is an hdmi adapter for some of the other galaxy_tabs but it does not work with the tab 2 7.0 i do not really care about this but if you do just be aware if anyone learns differently and verifies it with personal experience please let me know.original reviewok i have put off posting a review because i thought all of the 5-star reviews had already raved about the samsung galaxy_tab 2 7 sufficiently but i have been seeing too many low ratings that i consider unjustified so here it is this is such a great tablet i will simply try to counter some of the major cons that keep coming up as background i have owned or extensively used an ipad 4 android tablets and 4 android phones i do not at all claim to be an expert with android i am still a bit puzzled by many things but i have used enough android devices from 1.6 to 4.0 to have a bit of familiarity with the os and devices that run it.as i mentioned i do own an ipad though my wife has stolen it from me i bought the ipad strictly to make sure she would be able to use it easily anyway but its loss meant i had to get the android tablet i wanted to begin with right thank goodness because i am not an apple fan even i an admitted apple non-fan has to admit that apple devices work and work well even to me the ipad is the gold standard for tablets.battery life  this tablet has great battery life but you do have to practice reasonable power practices i charged mine overnight one night unplugged it in the morning used it admittedly very lightly and after 4 days battery still showed 75 i purposely used the tablet very lightly during this time since i was concerned with standby time read michael s comment regarding power saving steps here http://www.amazon.com/review/r3el7pm4ta0s2r/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewpnt#r3el7pm4ta0s2rwifi  many have reported wifi issues i don't think this tablet has a wifi problem in fact it has the best wifi performance of any android tablet i have tried consistently showing at least one bar more than any other if you have wifi issues try powering your router off and on or unplug then re-plug i have att uverse and i have to do this every time i try to connect a new device every new device gets obtaining ip address from or connected\"/\"disconnected even when i had cable and was able to use my own router i had to do this occasionally the galaxy_tab 2 7 has wifi performance equal to or better than any of the numerous devices i have used.move apps to sd  no as far as i have been able to determine you may not be able to move apps to sd even with app2sd or other such app but the device seems to have a ton of system space for apps  far more than normal users require older versions of android set aside system storage for apps that might be 256 512 or if you were lucky 1024mb on the galaxy_tab 2 apps seem to be installed in general storage apps space appears in the total space right now for instance my total space area says apps are taking 533mb and shows 3.86gb available so how much apps space do you need if you are super-gamer and need a bazillion gb of apps space then no this device might not be for you so go spend 400-500 on something else if you are a mere mortal like me i am pretty sure you will be extremely happy with this device.oh yeah the tab 2 has only 8gb of internal storage i have never cared about internal storage because i immediately stick a 32gb micro sd card in and make sure photos music and videos get stored there this tablet will accept a usb otg adapter so you can store unlimited extra videos on flash drives speaking of otg adapters you can get less expensive ones but this one is really neat:http://www.amazon.com/graybean-t-flash-keyboard-connection-samsung/dp/b0072fjea8/ref=sr_1_cc_3?s=aps&ie;=utf8&qid;=1336783341&sr;=1-3-catcorri bought one and i can attest that it does work with flash drives i just got it and i imagine it will do fine with a usb keyboard it has three usb ports plus slots for sd and other memory cards sorry haven't tried those yet either it also has a power input jack for supplemental power but i don't seem to have a plug that fits i will do more testing and post a review for that product soon i also have this onehttp://www.amazon.com/black-female-adapter-samsung-galaxy/dp/b005ywirbs/ref=sr_1_cc_2?s=aps&ie;=utf8&qid;=1336783341&sr;=1-2-catcorrand i can attest that it works too.oh it is not yet available on amazon but samsung makes a book cover that is the perfect case for the tab 2 just google galaxy_tab 2 case and you will find it it adds almost no bulk i can still put the tab in my pocket it is a little pricey right now from reputable sources but if you decide to go with one of the less expensive places make sure they actually have it if you dig many will say deliver something like 6/23 just be careful another note on this case  it opens to the right in portrait orientation but that is so it will open to the top in landscape it folds all the way back for one-hand use and the edges have tacky rubber strips so you can use as a stand at the angle of your choice it is very secure as a stand will not slide at all caution the book cover that amazon has right now is for the original tab 7 the back of the book cover case snaps on so the fit has to be perfect i don't think the book cover for the original tab will fit the tab 2 i got mine from od.this is hands down the best basic android device i have tried it is definitely the 7 tablet i have been waiting for everything works and works without spending hours researching how to get some feature to work\n",
      "i did a lot of research before buying this tablet as this was going to be my very first one as a happy phone android power user for three years i had no doubt it was to be an android tablet.regarding the size i decided 7 or 8 was my goal as i wanted it primarily as an e-book reader easy to hold with one hand i did really liked galaxy_note 8 however i couldn't justify the price for the extra features i also checked the nexus 7 which i believe has a better screen and more cpu power however i decided on the samsung galaxy_tab 2 7.0 because 1 it has an microsd slot 2 being a techie i know i will sell it in a year or so and in my area i can get more money back from a samsung tablet than an asus google and 3 because the price dropped from 200 to 169 in advance to the soon-to-come tab 3 announcement 4 it also looks nicer than the rather ugly nexus 7.performance so far i'm very satisfied with this tablet performance at games playing videos and browsing.display it's good but not great in yahoo mail fonts look a little washed up this was solved changin font size in system settings.e-book reader i've tried several e-book readers but i'm sticking with ub which is fast and renders nice fonts i wish this tablet was a little lighter but i still can hold in one hand for 15-20 minutes before switching hands.battery lot of juice charges fast and if i enable wi-fi only when needed it can last up to two days.sound very good stereo sound strong volume and neat sound).apps included it comes with a few nice apps samsung keyboard with swipe is very confortable peel ir remote control works ok up to 2 meters direct sight polaris office is a very good office app\n",
      "my husband gave this to me as a gift i had an ipad and a samsung galaxy_tab 7 i800 the old samsung that i had was also on verizon the biggest downfall from the old samsung tablet that i had to this was that the old tablet could send and receive text messages with the phone number that was associated with the device once i upgraded to this tablet i found that they had removed the texting capability my husband got this for me at best buy and they have a 15 day return window in less than 15 days i started having the device freeze up so i took it to best buy and discussed my troubles with the samsung guy turns out i was maxing out the ram even though i was constantly closing every application to make sure that nothing was running in the background i returned this device hooked the old device back to the verizon account and purchased a samsung galaxy_note 8.0 the note 8.0 has more ram i have had the note for a few months now and i have never had the problems that i had with maxing out the ram the note also has a pen which is great!with this said i am guessing that this device or it's non-4g wifi only equivalent would be great for someone who is planning to lightly use the tablet or for a kid\n",
      "i purchased this dock for my galaxy_note 2014 edition tablet i love both the tablet  this dock however since it did not come with a cable i purchased a 30 pin cable from wireless ground.com it came in a kit with a few other items i could use however the 30 pin cable plug would not fit into the back of the dock can anyone who had to purchase the cable specifically to use with this dock let me know exactly what you purchased i'd appreciate any help as i have this awesome tab  nice new dock but can't use them together  its driving me crazy please provide an item   all the specifics you can thank you so much for any responses\n",
      "i did read all reviews on amazon before making the purchase i know the screen and trackpad is awful and i thought i could live with it until now i have it on my hand and found out that this is that badi am by no means a photographer i am a student i've used many brands laptops apple hp toshiba and lenovo apple is the most user-friendly laptop other three are average windows laptops while samsung's laptops is not made for humanafter changing contrast and settings it gets better but still unacceptable it looks purple and everything looks wash out black does not looks black white does not looks white not to mention the insane trackpad moves as you are typing so you will end up with somewhere random it also make great noise when tying which is annoying both issues are stated in previous reviews and i regret that i did not listen to them i am going to send this thing back and wait for new generation to comethe only thing positive is the battery life but the screen and trackpad make this laptop totally unacceptablei also want to comment on amazon warehouse as i purchased a like new unit from them it supposed to be functional but the backlit keyboard and several function keys are apparently not working if they really ever check rather than just list it they should not ship this defective unit to me and list it as like new to confuse other costumers.samsung needs to focus on user's experience rather than putting specs all together making an device i own many samsung electrons including galaxy_note nexus while they are well made i still cannot compare the experience i had with them to that with apple's products\n",
      "i purchased this in december 2012 from fgs trading i do not recommend this vendor they got the product from hong kong formatted in chinese so i turned it on everything was in chinese i have nothing but respect for the chinese language but try to change the language when every last element is in chinese and everything you touch results in another instruction in chinese i tried to contact the vendor fgs trading twice they never responded.so i downloaded the manual and after some time managed to change the language by following the icons which are fortunately the same for all languages there was still considerable reformatting to do of various keyboards and options--which i was able to do after reading the manual.but enough griping about the vendor the product is great snapped in a sim card and it immediately downloaded and installed the settings very simple to set up as a wireless router my devices recognized it immediately stuck in a 64 gb memory device which should only be formatted in the tab then put it in my pc and downloaded my entire itunes library which was then read and organized by a popular free app rocket player--completely organized my podcasts albums playlists great google maps which i am using with the gps overseas surprisingly accurate voice recognition great for skyping as well as regular phone calls love the streaming radio which does just fine on the pretty pathetic bandwidth i have over here in nairobi kenya i have installed a free proxy server too which gives me access to ahem certain content that i would not ordinarily have access to just getting into the actual writing functions haven't paid for an app yet and it's lived up to all of my expectations all told an intuitive device that excels in all the areas that matter to me and i haven't even begun to explore all the apps that are out there the samsung galaxy_note 10.1 feels solid and does not disappoint.as for fsg trading i can't say a whole lot but if you happen to be chinese you are sure going to appreciate the chinese language options which are many fgs still not too late to apologize perhaps you should let your customers know what they are in for and how to deal with it\n",
      "this ultrabook is beautifully styled and super light it operates well but mine was delivered with a faulty battery so it only works when plugged in to a power supply.in order to fix this i had to ship it back to a samsung center i did that a week ago and am waiting to hear when i will get my replacement.very disappointing i am generally a samsung fan i have a galaxy_s3 phone and a galaxy_note 10.1 tablet\n",
      "i love samsung my wife and i both have samsung phones and i order the samsung smart tv's all the time for clients that want to use skype my dad purchased the 500t for my mother for christmas to go along with her new samsung galaxy_note ii which she loves and works great and i was looking forward to setting it up it because i was likely going to purchase the 700t for myself in january.when i opened the first box i noticed that the gray tape had already been cut open and when i turned it on it was in the middle of a recovery i went ahead and tried to configure it anyway it wouldn't take updates and it would fail on installations we contacted amazon and they sent a new one out the next day amazon was great about it.the second one was sealed properly and looked perfect i turned it on and set it up and was very impressed ran all the samsung and windows updates and then suddenly the touchscreen stopped working the pen worked but no touch did a complete rebuild of the os and it resulted in the same problem no touch screen.this device is not ready for prime time i usually tell clients to stay away from 1st generation devices and i should have taken my own advice do not buy\n",
      "edit 2/25/2013 keyboard won't stay connected!i repurchased this unit from amazon after first receiving a defective unit and was so pleased with all the updates that solved all my issues i left an overwhelmingly stellar review below though i finally receive my keyboard dock from staples thinking perhaps the dock disconnect issue was unique to amazon's stock  well folks it's not amazon's stock it's just samsung dock had to throw the rhyme in)!this issue is not homogeneous to the dock itself as i tried another bluetooth keyboard and it disconnects just the same so it's definitely a defect and with all the updates and fixes that came out making the tablet by itself a pleasure to use the fact that this keyboard disconnect issue has not been solved is leading me to believe the tablet is just simply defective hardware ridden that being said i love this tablet when using as just a tablet though i purchased it as a full laptop replacement and without the keyboard dock working productivity is greatly diminished and renders some tasks impossible altogether.now my question i will beg of anyone to answer if they can does anyone know of a way to remedy this unofficial update or driver outside the box ways to rig it up or anything of this nature i would hate to have to return this tablet again after falling in love with the thing not to mention the possibility of harming my amazon standing for having returned the same unit twice is this even allowed i'm at a loss here if anyone can help me at all i'd be extremely grateful the official description from samsung markets it as a desktop/laptop replacement but without the keyboard dock i can't even copy and paste in chrome at least and i'm not even going to attempt typing 40-50 page reports on a touch screen keyboard that blocks half the document from view at this point i can conclude it's hardware or driver failure that samsung has no fix for so i'm looking for any kind of a fix i love this tablet so much i'm willing to have a rigged up one rather than not have one at all.please help someone different model's driver a tinfoil hat etc like i said i'm open to any suggestion to get the dock to stay connected!intel atom is no longer what you may think if intel would have called it a core-a processor 98 of pc users would know the difference from an i3 except that somehow the battery is lasting all day long and i mean all day long clovertail would easily be mistaken for a 5th generation atom if someone were to go back in time 5 years with one of these tablets.*edit 2/22/2013  i have re-purchased this tablet and samsung has fixed every single issue and it now operates perfectly i have not had even a single not even one issue i now use this as my main computer my desktop with wireless keyboard and hdtv as my laptop and you guessed it as my tablet i did this without compromise 95-98 of us pc users do not need anything more powerful than a clovertail atom to experience full windows 8 without any hiccups whatsoever.here are some really helpful hints actually must-dos if you purchase this unit:(1 open it up plug it in and before you do anything complete all updates this will take a while but be patient or and do it first or you will hate life.(2 heard the 14.5 hour battery life myth well it's no myth read on..(this one is optional but i highly recommended it after the tablet has been fully charged mine both came fully charged i just topped up to be sure when doing updates which you must plug in the tablet for anyways purchase a micro hdmi cord 2 and a logitech k400 wireless keyboard/touch sensitive gesture friendly touch pad combo when you buy the tablet you will now have a complete desktop experience that is 10x better than the clamshell experience and 5x cheaper plug it up to a hdtv and select hardware setting in control panel then screen/monitor then display onto a second monitor and then select this is key display on second monitor/display only from there you will have full 1080 hd crystal clear and insanely sharp display also make sure to change the sleep function in control panel to not sleep ever for this operation without using only the second display setting it will be about 60 as good the difference is dramatic to say the least then you may play with the unit and do what ever you like download stuff explore etc etc just make sure now this is the punch line to use it like this until the battery is completely depleted you may have to leave it like that overnight or all day because this will take a good 15 plus hours or perhaps the magic number 14.5 doing this cycle two or three times is key however even once is better than never you will now have the longest lasting battery under any circumstances plugged in or not that you have ever experienced some brainiac is surely furious behind his keyboard screaming that the battery is of this or that capacity and this will not make it better well i beg to differ as an executive i have little time on my hands though i am so excited about this that i took the time to write it because it does work i did this on two separate units so it is not just a fluke unique to my unit.(3 enjoy i have already blabbed on and on about everything else about this machine)(4 overall experience has led me to ditch my x202 i3 asus and the ativ 700t as this unit does every single task i need it for just as fast nano seconds overlooked happily you get the insane battery life the same performance despite the core i5 hype as on any modern laptop  this is of course to say that if you do not need this machine for intensive gaming video editing or like demanding programs under which circumstances you would not be looking at this unit anyways for word processing email video chat/voip surfing the net researching etc what 98 of people use a laptop for this unit is indistinguishable again not minding the nano seconds from the 700t and at half the price i got mine for 549 right here you also get the full hd experience when projecting onto a monitor with the 700t i had to actually lower the resolution to make the desktop mode usable for normal computing you do not want the 1080 display for looking at pictures or watching movies(on your tablet only maybe but at sacrificing half the battery life gimme a break no thanks!alternative if the size and weight are an issue the asus me400 is a great alternative for even less than this mind you there will be no digitizer i got the me400 for taking in the car and things of that nature bottom line is the stigma of atom processors will be no more very shortly these things blaze correlation with low power consumption considered).(update 1/21/2013 i changed this from 2 stars to 5 stars and after 10 days am sticking with 4 stars i no longer think it's the best convertible value available but hope that soon it will be until then i have no choice but to return it and buy something predictable this is a machine not a moody assistant or is it the following paragraph begins my 5 star review and i title the update before the bottom three paragraphs post the most intense love-hate relationship i have ever had with a machine.let me start off by saying after some tweaking and updates this is hands down the best computer in the world i was cursing this thing out of the box as it seemed a huge joke as nothing was working right and if it did anything at all it was at a snails pace it reminded me of a 10 year old computer running windows 98 though after a dozen updates and some well worth the time research i now would not trade this computer for any other device out there not a chance!i bought both the 500t and the 700t second as i was determined to have a full laptop replacement in tablet form like others i have been anxiously awaiting the future of technology to make it a reality and the future is now  thanks samsung!first off cost aside made no difference to me as work was reimbursing me the 500t is the better device and the one i will be keeping i know some tech article reading person may beg to differ but i'm talking real world use replacing a go to desktop or laptop with a tablet pc the 700t has a nice screen and the processor is way superior on paper emphasis on paper).a tablet should have amazing battery life the 500t does in fact it blows the 700t out of the water the 500t provided all day battery life with 10 hours of real world use 14.5hr claims are floating around and they may be closer to reality than exaggeration the 700t's battery life is a joke really for the price that joke is cemented.and what about weight i want a light weight tablet and i feel confident that i can speak for the vast majority when i say they do too again the 500t blows away the 700t simply no comparison!this new generation dual core atom processor is much better than i expected though out of the box you may find yourself thinking otherwise at first because software bugs before you update will make the processor appear to be crappy it's not in fact for everything i've tried it's almost as fast as the i5 in the 700t again think real world use i say it's on par with a core i3 for most tasks slower yes though not enough to make the 500t undesirable at all plus this new generation of atom processors uses so little energy it makes the amazing battery life possible at first i swore atom processors were for toys at best but today i proudly call it my go to processor a tablet should be zippy and responsive and the 500t is the atom will handle even intensive programs like photoshop albeit a bit slower than the 700t but you must ask yourself what percent of the time will you be using this for photoshop and other intensive programs before you decide how much the split second difference of rendering your input command matters.the digitizer and s-pen can we say amazing after having owned and returned the galaxy_note 10.1 i can say the 11.6 real estate makes a huge difference for the everyday user like myself i can see artists being thrilled and it feels much more responsive and overall better than the note.i can't say i wouldn't have preferred brushed aluminum though the plastic is by no means cheap and it does appear to be brushed aluminum with the finish samsung chose for the 500t.resolution yes i did really like the full hd screen of the 700t but in no way was it worth sacrificing the battery life of the 500t the 500t is super bright and crisp and despite the 1366 number i love the screen when you output the hdmi into a full 1080p monitor or tv it displays in 1080 which since i use a 32 1080p display when at home as my monitor is a huge plus for me.the a/c adapter though not as big as a full size laptop charger is bigger than say my asus x202e tablet style/size a/c adapter which i would have preferred though again not a deal breaker considering you most likely will not even need to bring the charger with you it's not a big deal at all.dock the dock feels cheap to a point i much prefer the logitech wireless keyboard with the built in touch pad with multi touch gestures k400 model for only 29 this keyboard with a arrowhead griffen stand 5 amazon is the way i like it it appears to be a very futuristic desktop that you can pick up and use as a tablet at any moment it's lighter and i have a full size keyboard and don't have to compromise my typing speed or get used to a little keyboard and hey it's way cheaper).bottom line is if you are purchasing this after january 10th 2013 the bug fixes via updates are available and after you update and remove some bloatware this will be your dream device if you are looking for a true tablet that can actually replace your desktop or laptop for actual productivity and creation i had the choice to keep this or the 700t or any other full windows tablet convertible etc and i chose the 500t and in no way do i feel like i settled'.in conclusion this is now my dream pc it's zippy and capable and has the best battery life of any tablet i've ever encountered and i've used all of the best out there it's super light weight compared to any other comparable full windows tablet and it is 11.6 which is sweet for using the s-pen and everything else for that matter the processor is more than capable the resolution is great the 500t is the whole package!that being said don't expect to take this machine out of the box and love it or you will be very disappointing if you have been waiting for a true desktop replacement in a tablet and have some patience and enthusiasm this machine will be your go to advice as well i can almost promise you that much i would suggest keeping it plugged in all day and doing all the updates before even trying to use it because you may find yourself mistaking it for defective or just crap if you don't.so there you have it i had the 500t and the 700t in my hands for a weekend my work said i could keep which ever i liked better and after a full weekend of throwing everything i could at both i decided i would much rather keep the 500t as i said before i cursed this machine out of the box but now i wouldn't trade it for any computer regardless of price!i will update this review if i have any problems in the future if i help even one other person to get a tablet to once and for all replace their desktop or laptop without having to accept any significant compromise the time it took to write this review was worth it samsung has caused some trouble and confusion releasing this machine before it was ready and supported with proper driver and software updates but i can truly say even being a anti samsung consumer that samsung has hit a home run with this device in the end perhaps in the 9th inning but never the less it's a win for samsung and a win for me!i love the 500t i'm a computer expert and know what i'm talking about for the purpose it was created to serve it is hands down a wonderful ground breaking futuristic all in one solution to those looking for a full featured tablet if you have a little patience buy this unit!*edit 1/18/2013 after a week of use and the most effort i have ever put into making trying to a device work as advertised*after a week of using this though i will stick to saying that this has potential to be one of the greats when it works right it does occasionally which is too often in my line of work freeze up and or drop and forget the wifi connection which sometimes requires several restarts to fix if you are working on something that can be a pain or in my line of work mean your back-side i don't know if this is still a driver/firmware/software issue(s that can be fixed or if it is just first gen hardware reality also the micro hdmi output is just putting out less than the stated resolution to my external monitor it's noticeably more grainy than my sister's ultra book with the same stated output.and as far as using it as a tablet only and or as a second or additional device in which you have something else to use when you cannot accept the issues this one has go for it but if you are wanting to use a this tablet as your main computer and you are dependent on computing for work even though i wish this was up to that job it just isn't yet as much as i don't want to return this unit i have to as i need a device that will work 100 of the time not 90 or even 95 but 100 if samsung decides to fully fix this device i would buy it again but until the bugs get worked out 100 i must find a bug-less machine.please samsung i beg you fix the bugs and support this device all the way and i will buy it back 600 is a steal but only if it works the same on tuesday as it did on monday etc as hard as it is i have no choice but to return this until it just works like it should consistently\n",
      "update***samsung contacted me and offered to replace this tablet with the newer branded ativ tab 5 which is the exact same unit with a new name and model number the only difference between this model and the replacement is a few software changes the exchange took longer than it should have but the new unit did arrive as promised a week and a half after shipping my faulty unit back by that time i had already chosen to sell the replacement and use that money to purchase a smaller windows 8.1 tablet from dell that would better fit my needs be aware that this tablet will run most of your windows 8 apps that run in the modern ui with little-to-no lag and will operate most desktop apps with no trouble but its processor will not handle the same workload one may expect of a good laptop or desktop neither was it meant to because samsung finally stepped up and took responsibility for the horrible scenario their service and customer support teams put me in i upgraded my rating to 3 stars but this problem should never have happened to begin with this is a decent tablet for light to moderate use and would make a great starter tablet for someone interested in windows tablets but wishing to retain the ability to run some desktop apps keep that in mind when choosing to buy one._____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________my initial review for this tablet was very positive however i spoke far too soon when i received the ativ 500t it had a recurring issue with dropping hidden networks on restart necessitating the reentry of connection criteria to access the internet and the bluetooth card continually failed any outgoing ftp transaction even though it had no trouble accepting an incoming one i spoke to customer support sever times over this issue in the first few weeks i had to tablet refreshed windows 8 and even did a full factory restore at their recommendation all to no avail i was promised the issue would be reported to technical support and never heard another word back from them even when i initiated contact again a few months later after roughly 5 1/2 months of using the tablet the display started to develop image retention in the upper left corner of the screen whenever i would switch between screens an image of whatever had been in the upper-left corner from the previous screen would be visible still on the new screen for a few minutes within a week of noticing this the issue worsened to a 1/4 inch band around all four edges of the display at that point i contacted the same person with customer support i had dealt with before and after asking me to refresh windows again i don't know what it is with those people but reinstalling the os is not the answer to everything he arranged for the tablet to be shipped to a 3rd party repair center to have the display replaced i got the tablet back almost exactly a week later with two cracks in the plastic frame around the outside edge of the display and the screen showing the exact same image retention issue it had when it left my hand the week before to be fair the image retention was back to the milder presence it had when the problem first started but worsened right back to the same 1/4 inch band on all four edges of the display within a week i contacted samsung customer support at which point they filed a claim with ups even though i clearly explained to this representative that the tablet was properly packaged in its original box with its original packing material all of which was packed in a second box and both boxes were in exceptional condition upon receipt almost a week later the representative called and left a voice mail telling me that ups refuted the claim and thanked me for giving her the opportunity to help me i immediately called customer support back and was told that they would be happy to send the tablet back to intelisol inc the 3rd party repair center to have the display replaced again but would take zero responsibility for the damage to my unit i got the email address for the office of the president of samsung electronics america's customer service department and immediately sent a very heated email outlining how samsung needs to be responsible for the 3rd party organization they hire to do warranty work on products purchased by their customers which was sent four days ago and still has been completely ignored i resent the message two days later with an automated return receipt request and a notice of read request both of which i got from addresses within samsung tchoe@sea.samsung.com  hnam@sea.samsung.com but no one has yet to even respond to my request for help i have been a loyal customer of samsung's for many years owning two tv's blue-ray players and always the latest samsung android flagship smartphone i currently have the galaxy_note 3 which i have only had to two weeks and as such i am appalled at the lack of concern for the deplorable lack of customer service displayed by samsung in this issue i am filing a complaint with the better business bureau unfortunately for them i kept copies of every single email communication i have had regarding this unit from day one pertaining to the company's complete lack of owning up to their responsibility with this situation i highly recommend anyone thinking about a windows 8 tablet purchase from dell lenovo or any one of the many computer manufacturers who stand behind their products with quality support when things do go wrong\n",
      "i have surface pro 128gb but the heavy weight started to bug me also tiny menu when using photoshop cs5 was irritating  not sure how macpro retina display handles photoshop menu....i also have samsung note 10.1 and will compare them.pros:1 price i paid 1/3 of what i paid for surface pro 128.2 built in wacom pen s-pen with pressure sensitivity one of the reason why i have all these stylus enabled tablet  photoshop and sketch pro.3 11 inch wide screen the extra one inch makes huge difference the screen is not crispy as surface pro but no issue watching movies viewing angle is excellent not sure if this is ips screen 11 inch means more estate to work on photoshop and holding the tablet to read kindle books make me feel like i'm moses holding the 10 commandments tablet.4 light and thin people complains about plastic and looking cheap to me i rather have lighter tablet than heavy one i like surface pro's solid feel but it's really hard to hold them up while you lie down  excellent for lazy like me this one feels about 1/2 the weight and 1/2 the thickness.4 rotation lock button  this is the button every tablet should have.6 runs cool surface pro runs warm to touch after 5 minutes of usage this one never get even warm.7 runs full version of photoshop cs5 and other windows app including ms office photoshop touch was o.k on note 10.1 but no comparison to full version of cs5.8 samsung app  the mini s note is very good even if i have office note i use mini s-note however i found android version on galaxy_note 10.1 has much more feature.9 battery life seems pretty good i didn't test fully though.10 no hdml double needed i spent extra for surface pro and note 10.1 to buy a dongle ativ500t has built in hdmi out port.11 good sound  unlike other laptop compare to my very old lenovo x60 or even surface pro it has good sound.11 windows8 os.12 galaxy_note 10.1's are more entertaining more small games remote control with tv guide app etc but windows 8 give you a bit of android like app usage and full windows os environment i have not played any 3d games on this yet maybe try farcry3 or skryrim later.13 option to have a keyboard doc that works really like a laptop ms surface pro's cover type keyboard are good but it's really cumbersome and awkward to use on one's lap also cover type mouse pad is very hard to use because of it's small size.cons1 power adapter connector is horrible sometimes i had to push and hold it for it to charge ridiculous.2 made in china again adapter port and headset port are very bad probably using cheap made in china part samsung should keep the factory in korea.3 slower boot up time than surface pro but way faster than any standard laptop  compared to my work laptop lenovo t430.4 slower speed when multitasking sometimes it got to a point where touch response is not responding for about a second or two.5 small space 64gb version has about half taken away by win8 os leaving you wiht some 27gb space must to have microsd if you are listening to mp3 collection or watching movie collection i purchased 64gb samsung microsd pro when i purchase this tablet under 50 and setup my outlook pst file to the microsd card.5 bloatware i uninstalled norton photoshop element and ms office 2010 which requires key that's different than my version i would go with quicker and less demanding free antivirus program.for those of you who miss old winxp or win7 start button i use little program call classic shell it's free download program at sourceforge this made w8 usable and i think it's actually better os than windows 7 i now love start screen where you can run apps and i.e in android style.i have not used keyboard dock that has notorious connection issues but can't wait to try one\n",
      "i went to a local office depot and was able to get my hands on both the samsung ativ smart pc and the hp envy 2x 11 convertible  upon which the samsung imitation seems to be based both are about the same size very similar case very similar connection between the tablet and keyboard portions both are touch screen and both run the full version of windows 8 with 2 gigs of ram and an atom processor however...i found the responsiveness of the touch screen having the tablet respond correctly to what i was selecting very different between the two comparables when working in small type areas the hp tablet/screen was far more responsive and selected the intended item from the drop down menu correctly most of the time it performed much better than the samsung i think this is the same area where apple products often triumph over android  in the responsiveness of the touch screen and here it seemed that the higher quality brand does in fact triumph over the imitator i don't hate samsung i have a galaxy_note just sayin.)so while there are so many considerations over all  for me i felt this was a considerable issue i don't want to be frustrated with a computer that is constantly fighting with me on the touch screen  like i am with my phone so i'm leaning towards the hp envy convertible instead.ps my stars rating pertains to just the touch screen functionality of the product i don't feel qualified to compare the computer as a whole without spending time on both machines i did und up buying the hp envy convertible i am feeling about 3.5 to 4 on the product so far\n",
      "update netflix works 5/5 stars now!this is essentially a netbook running a wifi based operating system with apps basically being bookmarks that open tabs for websites.that's it!you won't find much functionality without wifi if you are in a place without wifi and have a little tech skill you should be able to set up your phone as a wifi hotspot i have even found a way to tether/hotspot my galaxy_note 2 with sprint without having to enable the option through them(who likes paying for functionality you should have for free right?)so you have to be in a wifi area or be willing to tether your book to your phone.this chromebook uses the arm based processor so netflix hulu and amazon streaming do not yet work.if you want those to work out of the box you will be better off going with the acer c7 which runs an intel processor with a little more pep and support for those services at the expense of a warmer running temperature and a shorter battery life.my mom has the acer c7 and loves it.these little laptops are for web browsing 95 of the time you can play flash games easy enough and write emails and use evernote or google docs to type things up if you really need to you can even set up a printer really easily it does take a little getting used to though working settings through a chrome tab.i like having an extremely portable device to mess with.that said i do still use a toshiba 13 laptop and a gaming pc this won't replace those entirely this is good for the bedroom really sitting with it on your lap for 4 hours reading the news emailing friends checking amazon updating facebook or twitter.it's simple cheap and i love it oh and it doesn't support a ton of video formats so don't expect it to be used for a lot of video watching encode things in mp4 if you really want to watch them avi and mkv aren't working for me at the moment\n",
      "as a developer i had read a lot about the chromebooks and some workarounds to make it more of an option as a development machine if it had a better ssh client or more properly an xserver implementation it would be perfect to use as a thin client to my dev box there are definitely online development platforms that this could work for but they don't fit into my current workflow.but that isn't how it is marketed and for everything else i wanted to do it has been great having a phablet galaxy_note and a couple of other tablets and a laptop i use to remote into my desktop this is the device i grab to watch netflix or write emails or have a second screen watching tv the startup is quick the multi-user setup is nice and the keyboard is surprisingly good i normally use an ergonomic keyboard but can type quite well on this one and out of all of my devices this one seems quickest to connect to my wifi network on waking and has the best throughput\n",

      "this is a fantastic tablet fast easy to use long battery life some have said that charging is slow but i really don't think it's that bad i have also read that it will not charge while playing a game as it goes down faster than charging but that is no reason not to plug it in while using it i run it heavy for 1 to 2 days before charging over night android 4.3 is really nice because you can have multiple user profiles this is important for the kids so that they have independent saved game positions they fight a lot about this on the dsixl wii and nook the rubber back makes it easy to hang on to it is great for netflix and even dlna streaming i use it for too many things to list here however it is wifi only and does not have an sd slot for this i recommend getting the 32gb version and signing up for things like dropbox or google drive both free for mobile internet connectivity i just tether to my samsung galaxy_note 2 and use the 4g which works really well the google nexus is actually made by samsung so it is a good product it does also have bluetooth nfc hdmi out and a standard micro usb charging port there is another charging port on the bottom for a 34;quick charger&#34 it is also compatible with several bluetooth keyboard covers and i even use a bluetooth netbook mouse with it it's almost like a notebook at that point i believe this is the best tablet to date\n",
      "i was waiting to see if the mythical nexus 10 2 would ever come out and after waiting 3 months i gave up and purchased this in december 2013 i love this tablet and i wish i had not waited for so long the tablet is quick and snappy it's not bloated with pre-installed apps i was thinking about getting the galaxy_note 10.1 2014 edition but after playing with that and the nexus 10 at best buy i decided to purchase this on amazon the note was just too full of crap and slow\n",
      "why i got this:before getting this i had gotten and returned a chromebook and windows 8 hybrid laptop the chromebook was close to being something that i would keep but windows 8 convinced me that microsoft is egotistical and out of touch so i decided to stick with android my goal was to have something that i could take to the coffee shop with me or just use around the house i wanted something that was good enough to almost serve as a laptop without getting into any heavy tasks gaming video editing etc).what i like:the screen is beautiful of course this is the major reason most people get the nexus 10 even almost 2 years since it's release the screen sharpness measured in pixels per inch is higher than many new tablets coming out i love the the ability for multiple user accounts i can lend my tablet to someone without them having to see my private files or risk having them install stuff i personally do not want this is especially a handy work around to running the tablet for 2 modes work and personal i like the big bezels because it actually is practical on a 10 inch tablet i can hold this with both hands having a place to rest my thumbs the material on the back really nice there mostly isn't any unnecessary bloatware considering that most users will want to install many google applications nexus also gets the latest updates which i appreciate a lot even when google stops supporting this i will be able to easily root and continue upgrading this.what i don't like:the android os really isn't 1 size fits all i have the same os kit kat on my nexus 7 2013 and my galaxy_s4 it works beautifully on these devices but isn't well suited for a 10 inch tablet google could have easily worked around this issue by giving users the ability to change the location of the software keys multitasking home back instead i have to constantly change the position of my hands to awkwardly reach for the multi tasking button.i don't care what reviewers say this thing is laggy there will be many times i get lag when just switching programs or between screens my touchwiz galaxy_note 2 running earlier versions of android is much smoother than the nexus 10 it simply doesn't go as fast as i think it should have.would i buy it again:no unless i got it for 70 to a hundred bucks cheaper for the 10 inch and higher tablet space i think the asus transformer has the best idea i ultimately chose this unit for its price and the hope that i could emulate the transformer by later buying add ons keyboard mouse etc i have hooked up a mouse and keyboard to the nexus 10 and it really isn't that intuitive to navigate.there will probably be a better and updated version in the future i think the nexus 10 should have eliminated the flash back facing camera and vibration to focus on performance issues after getting the superior nexus 7 from asus i had a lot of buyer remorse about buying this tablet and i am looking for ways to use it\n",
      "with the google nexus 10 google and samsung have managed to come up with a technological wonder google has made the right calls in term of aesthetics and industrial design while samsung was able to bring the best hardware to the game the display is beautiful and the system has enough muscles to handle any media you throw at it.the most surprising aspect of the google nexus 10 is the price at 399 16gb wifi the google nexus 10 is significantly cheaper than apple's ipad 4 which beats it only in polygonal graphics this is a very aggressive pricing especially if you think that this powerful tablet costs a mere 70 more than the ipad mini which is far less potent.if you want a tablet for basic things like email web gaming and apps this is the best option for now it is both cheaper and better than most of the competition there are a few exceptions if you want a stylus the samsung galaxy_note 10.1 is a better alternative and if you need microsoft office compatibility the microsoft surface rt would be better unless you absolutely want ios there is simply no compelling reason to pay 100 more for an ipad if you do well it's settled\n",

      "i bought this as a smaller alternative to my ipad i love the red garnet cover and device it's a refreshing change from the standard black or white in the us getting online and downloading apps was quick and easy this version of the android operating system seems smooth and more user friendly i added a 32gb microsd card for audiobooks and ebooks i intend to use this as an ereader but it's nice to have the option of checking email and purchasing more books when i can access wi-fi this was a limited edition issue so anyone interested had better act fast.04/07 i still love my device and the beautiful red color but i am back in africa and the device is having a hard time staying connected to the internet i've read other reviews and some people are having the same problem i've been able to download a few apps but i have trouble downloading my kindle ebooks i took it out of its case but that didn't help this doesn't work as well as my galaxy_note 2 which works like a charm and stays connected when i'm downloading battery life has been pretty good though overall this fails as a possible replacement to my ipad that's okay because this was an impulse buy still love the red color-so gorgeous\n",
      "i love the clear and sharp pictures and videos the samsung 32gb microsd shows on my galaxy_note 3 phone fast downloads beautiful pictures so clear and excellent hd video this is the only brand name sd card that will work with the samsung galaxy_s4 and samsung note 3 phones.to save anyone any trouble if they are using the brand name sandisk sd card in their samsung s4 phone or samsung note 3 phone please read below this issue is only related to those two phones as far as i have found out using the sandisk sd class 10 card.i transferred the sandisk class 10 32gb from my other galaxy 3 phone into my new samsung note 3 phone i was able to use it for about 2 weeks but i had noticed that the pictures i took really were not as clear as i had expected or the videos either then my sandisk sd card kept unmounting itself i would mount it back in and restart  i had like 6 months of pictures and videos on that card evenutally my new phone did not recognize it and could not bring them up so i downloaded to my computer and it says no pictures or videos it was like a blank card was upset to have lost all that data.i went on line and also looked under reviews and found out that anyone who owned the galaxy_note 3 or galaxy_s4 phone had the same issues as i had that was using sandisk sd cards it also said that sandisk was aware of this problem and was trying to fix the issue unfortunately the consumer is not made aware of this issue.thank goodness i read how to possibly get all my pictures and videos back i had to put the old sandisk sd card back on my note 3 and download the app from play store called rescan sd and if your card was not too corrupted may temporarily bring back up lost data  i rescanned the sd card and amazingly brought back all lost data so took outthe sandisk sd card and downloaded all data to my computer then i threw out the sandisk card thought about using it in my camera but afraid that the card had been corrupted in my nikon camera i have a sandisk 32gb class 10 and have had no issues.now using samsung 32gb micro sd  the clarity of pictures are now as they should be and great videos and have had no problems.i also looked under transcend brand name on sd cards  under reviews saw owners of galaxy_s4 and note 3 phones having same issues as i did with the sandisk sd cards\n",
      "i got it from another vendor this laptop has very nice spec the performance is a bit slow presumably due to the 5400rpm hard drive i added another 8gb of ram to it and did not improve much in starting up upgrading to win8.1 was much smoother than i thought although it took many hours as you have to update all the files and drivers first then i found it would not work in f4 recovery mode anymore once upgraded to 8.1 so you should first create the re-installation disc before doing the upgrade anyway it works great in win8.1 and there is little reason to go back as long as you have created a restoration image on a thumb drive just in case the oversized touch pad is problematic it is so big that it is hard to do a left click or right click the touch screen is very responsive but be prepare to wipe the screen on a daily base over all the laptop performs okay and has the spec i want the only problem i found other than losing the f4 recover function is a defective enter key on the numeric keypad size also due to the numeric keypad the keyboard is a bit crowded the keys have little travel distance that one may not like the keyboard i have to return the laptop due to the defective key otherwise it would be a keeper with the great price i paid on cyber monday nevertheless it would be overpriced to be sold at 1000.1/29/2014 update:i received a replacement unit from vendor last week the f4 receovery function still does not work however i can backup the recovery partition onto a thumb drive using the recovery function in windows 8 with that i can do a recovery to factory setting then i went through all the updates before upgrading to windows 8.1 according to the instruction using the windows app store after the upgrade i did the sw update and windows updates again one critical update for windows 8.1 uefi failed unless i changed the secure boot setting then i found samsung has removed the recovery application for win8.1 which was on the list last month as it could not be installed anyway nevertheless the audio driver in sw update cannot be installed it is fine as the previous version seems to work without problem finally i manually update the audio driver in device manager i don't have any driver problem after the whole update process at the end one issue i found though after i shut down the laptop and put it into my laptop bag it will automatically reboot into f4 mode by itself i found out an hour later and it got so hot inside the bag this is finally solved by turning off secure boot i still don't know what is causing the problem besides that the ativ 6 is performing well so far.2/6/2014 update:i just found the sidesync to be missing on the laptop nor on the sw update it is not a big deal as they are going to release the sidesync 3.0 for free very soon i also tested the bluetooth connection the signal is very good i can use a bt headset 1 floor up and 10m away without any disruption or noise i have tested the performance of it by ripping bluray video using an external bd drive it performed much better than my htpc with a 6-core amd processor and 8gb ram the whole process was completed in 30min which is less than half the time of my htpc the online support is a joke though tried 2 different ways to chat with support the s service chat referred me back to samsung service center the online chat cannot answer my question but created a case for it and forwarded my question to someone else.4/17/2014 update:finally found the sidesync 2.0 from sw update using another laptop model the samsung support people responded to me saying my ativ 6 is not compatible with sidesync what a joke as it has a sidesync label on it the installation is smooth my galaxy_note 8.0 does not have kitkat 4.4 yet so the sidesync 3.0 does not work for me i now have both sidesync 2.0 and 3.0 installed now as i am expecting the kitkat android 4.4 update on my note 8.0 soon both keyboard/mouse sharing and screen mirroring are working i have also tested the widi output using an iogear receiver it works very well i he added back one star to it from 3-star it would be a 5-star if i did not have that keyboard issue with the first unit\n",
      "i did months of research because the only reason i needed a pc is for photoshop the display is sharp and the keyboard is great i was even surprised by the sound quality the only issue i had upgrading to windows 8.1 is that you have to do all the windows 8.0 upgrades before the 8.1 upgrade shows available at the microsoft store one of samsung's video display recommended updates did crash the the laptop only after 48 hours of ownership but samsung was awesome at helping me get the computer back to stock then the video upgrade software took fine.there are no delays even when running several apps at the same time i have even tried taxing the cpu to see what it will handle and it has not even shuttered with a single lag.if you can't stand fingerprints then don't touch the touchscreen the glossy screen does show fingerprints but that is the trade-off of having such a beautiful looking screen.i have a samsung galaxy_note android phone setting up the sidesync is not as easy as they make it seem on the samsung website still having a little trouble with it but i am sure a phone call to samsung or a few moments watching youtube will solve my issue.best laptop i have owned and there have been many so i am happy with my purchase and the months of research i had to ignore the reviews with major problems because i know when there is a problem people will voice their opinion in a heartbeat but when thing just work and there are no issues most people say nothing and just go on with the product using it as intended\n",
      "i've had this camera for about 3 months now and have used it on a regular basis first off this is not my one and only camera but an edc everyday carry i purchased this camera as a compact camera that i can fit in my bag and take everywhere everyday i previously owned the wb150f and i was very pleased with its performance as i stated in that review if you are looking to purchase a camera with spectacular iq akin to dslrs or even iq on par with high end compact cameras this camera is not for you however if you're looking for a camera that takes pretty good pictures has the convenience of wifi to upload quickly to fb to share your photos with your friends/family has the capacity to quickly transfer photos between your camera and your smartphone and has a great optical zoom range you might want to consider this camera.when i was trying to decide what compact camera to buy this year i brought my choices down to 1 wb250f 2 canon powershot sx280 hs and 3 samsung galaxy camera the canon was tempting because admittedly it probably has better iq than either of the samsung cameras however it lacked the touchscreen that wb250f has and i know that inputing passwords and email info on a non-touchscreen was too much of a hassle for me truthfully the samsung galaxy camera was my number one choice it has full android on board with 3g/4g service it has everything that the wb250f has plus more but it came with a bigger price tag on what is essentially last year's technology the galaxy camera is basically a wb850f merged with a galaxy_s3 smartphone minus the call feature after much thought i decided to get the wb250f since the price was cheaper and i couldn't justify paying the early adopter tax for last year's technology the cpu and ram is better on my galaxy_note 2 the screen is bigger on my note 2 than the galaxy camera considering how easy it is to connect my note 2 to my wb250f i am pleased that i made the right choice for me.since there are quite a few detailed reviews of the wb250f on tech/photo sites i'll just touch on things that i noticed while using this camera for the last 3 months.iqgreat iq comes with a price tag the iq for the price of this camera is absolutely fine with me sure if this was a high end compact camera or a dlsr lens i would've been disappointed but for a sub-$200 compact i have no complaints the photos are sharp enough and if you want it sharper there is an option to increase the sharpness under image adjust there are many options to increase the vividness of the color you could select the vivid option in smart mode or even set the contrast and saturation higher in image adjust low light performance is great for its size high iso tends to be grainy but i think it is usable up to iso800 also the low light option under smart mode does a pretty good job although some images might appear soft depending on how dark the environment is.zoomi love the optical zoom to have this much optical zoom in a camera this tiny is very useful for me especially when i am hiking and run into wildlife as someone else mentioned the zoom is not smooth so micro adjustments are hard to make it's not a deal breaker for me i can live with it.focusthe wb250f hunts for focus at full zoom in darker environment or at very close macro since i usually use asm mode most of the time i just set the focus manually.featuresi don't use automatic mode so i can't comment on the effectiveness of that i really enjoy using the asm mode or the smart mode depending on the situation and i have been pleased with the results i also use the tilt-shift filter here and there for fun also this camera takes gif so i've had lots of fun making them straight from the camera.connectivityi have had no issues connecting my phone to the camera using the samsung smart camera app file transfers are quick and the remote viewfinder works great i have also connected the camera with my ipad without any problems the camera connects seamlessly to my netgear router and i have had no issues uploading my photos directly to fb.conclusionthe wb250f is a great fun camera if you purchase it knowing its limitations it will never give you dslr-like nor high end compact camera iq if iq is the single most important factor for you then it's probably better to spend a little more money and buy a different camera if you're just looking for a compact camera that is fun to use has connectivity features and produces good photos then you might want to give this camera a go since pictures speak a thousand words you might want to do a search on flickr for the camera and see what everyday users have uploaded\n",

      "great keyboard i like how easily my 10.1 galaxy_note fits in this it's a very stable connection it's more weighted than the samsung bluetooth version and obviously a little bigger than the bluetooth keyboard due to having the tablet attached to the keyboard i find it so much easier to type using a keyboard when writing emails or filling forms on the internet i do use thumb keyboard for my on-device keyboard that makes it much easier to type but this keyboard lets me type without having to 34;think&#34 as much about what keys to hit thankfully i am old enough to say that i took a typewriting class in high school and can type without looking a physical keyboard thanks to the little upraised ridges on the f and j keys then again i guess i'm old enough to say that texting isn't quite as easy for me than it is my nieces/nephews.)i also have the keyboard for my galaxy_plus 7  which will also work for the 10.1 galaxy_tab and note if you take out the black stabilizing tray i had contacted samsung to see if they even sold replacement trays but apparently they don't although perhaps i should have hinted that the tray for 10.1 keyboard broke instead of trying to just get a tray for a different tablet i mean why be able to take it out if it can't be replaced?oh well  i'm still happy with the keyboard it does what i want\n",
      "i've actually bought two keyboards which were me too's and the was always something cheap that didn't work well with them.this keyboard was made by samsung for samsung products and so it's made to work with little idiosyncracies i like the sturdy feel of it and the keys sturdy and quite operable are well placed if i could give this keyboard ten stars i would!samsung ecr-k14awegsta galaxy keyboard dock for the 10.1 galaxy_tab and galaxy_note\n",
      "i wanted something ultra-portable that i could use for everything  reading games writing email web-surfing etc i compared features and prices of all the reasonably priced tables and narrowed my choices down to the google nexus 7 and the samsung note 8 after some research i decided that the samsung galaxy_note 8.0 was exactly what i was looking for  the right size the right features the right everything at 399 it was more expensive than the other possibilities but i am so happy that i didn't allow this purchase to be driven by price i especially like the built in s-pen feature but the screen also responds very well to a regular stylus i use my tablet every day and have never been happier with a tech purchase\n",
      "people are comparing this to the ipad mini and the nexus 7 but there is no comparison as this comes with the s pen digitizer stylus it is a premium price for this feature but i love the s pen i'm sick of capacitive styli and i was willing to pay for this feature if you aren't interested in having a digitizer stylus then there are a host of 7-8 inch class tablets for a lot less money if you want a tablet with this feature that's less that 10 inches this is your baby.i don't find the resolution to be a problem with any but the smallest fonts and the system is powerful enough to be fast and fluid in every way other people have covered pros and cons fairly well so i'll add some other things i noticed:the note 8.0 uses the same micro usb cable and 5v 2 amp charger that came with my galaxy_note 2 i'm used to the proprietary connection on larger tablets so this was an unexpected perk.there's a lack of cases out there right now for this size device but i have a timbuck 2 sleeve for my old kindle 2 that fits perfectly the inside dimensions of the sleeve are 150 mm by 222 mm 5-7/8 inches by 8-3/4 inches and it fits perfectly you could probably fit it in a case with the inside dimensions of 140 cm x 212 cm but you'd need some depth to the case a sleeve that tight might not fit).update 1 4/24/2013for reference i've also owned the asus tf101 tf201 and tf700 tablets i currently use a galaxy_note 2 phone previously i've used a galaxy_nexus droid 3 and droid x my impression of the note 8 is based on comparisons to the other android devices i've used.now that i've had this for several weeks i absolutely love it the size is perfect for taking with me to work it's light and easy to hold for hours the s pen takes some practice to learn the commands but now i can take a screenshot and make notes on it in seconds the s note app is the best i've used for handwritten notes the palm rejection finally makes it so i can use a tablet as a notebook you can import pdfs or images and make notes on them and you can export them back out as pdfs or images i've used the split screen a few times to make notes while i watch a video lecture that feature is very nice.battery life is excellent for a tablet i get about 7-8 hours of screen time use before it hits 25%-30 my cutoff for plugging it in screen use is streaming netflix browsing the internet playing games etc standby uses almost no power i haven't let it sit unused for more than 8 hours but the battery drop is minimal i did set wifi to turn off when the screen isn't on this helps out battery life on any android device.i've turned off the motion detection and eye detection the eye detection had trouble with my eyes maybe because i wear glasses?the included ir apps are pretty useless to me we don't have cable on our tvs we use streaming services bluray and gaming consoles i have two samsung tvs one from 2009 one from 2010 neither worked well with the included ir apps there is an app on the play market that is compatible with the note 8 ir blaster touchsquid samsung at 19 for the home version it's expensive but then i realized that the logitech harmony remote i bought a couple years ago was four times the price and died in 3 months so i bought the app and while it has a huge learning curve i can control my tvs dvd bluray xbox360 and roku devices with the note very cool.for the control freaks out there the note 8 rooted in seconds using framaroot with the aragorn exploit this voids the warranty unless you explicitly know why you want to root don't do it.the entire system is fast and fluid there's no issue with opening a youtube link watching the video the switching back to the browser or app my poor formerly beloved tf700 infinity has barely been touched since i got the note 8 because it had big problems with fluid transitions bluetooth connections to external speakers jawbone jambox and headphones lg tone hbs-700 keep the audio in sync with the picture another problem that my tf700 could never overcome.the samsung keyboard is awesome i love the swipe input and one-hand mode swipe input on tablets can be hit or miss depending on the keyboard but the samsung keyboard in one-hand mode is small enough so swipe inputs can be done quickly also it will automatically open handwriting recognition when the s pen is pulled out previously swype was my keyboard of choice but the samsung keyboard is the most functional and comprehensive stock keyboard i've ever used.i continue to see reviews comparing this to the ipad mini and nexus 7 i stand by my assertion that there simply is no comparison neither has expandable storage digitizer stylus or ir blaster the stylus and ir blaster are not must-have features but they are 100 worth the price difference it takes some time to really explore all of the features but i'm impressed with the functionality of this tablet\n",
      "this is the best tablet i ever have it has the perfect size perfect weight and perfect pen i always want to buy the galaxy_note 10 to take notes  but its weight holds me off this is a perfect forming machine that fits my needs perfectly\n",
      "i had it narrowed down to this tablet the galaxy_note 10.1 2014 and possibly an ipad comparable in price to the note 10.1).i saw this one for 230 factory refurbished the price was irresistible.i couldn't be happier i was concerned that the screen was a little to small i use this mainly for watching videos often on plane rides and grading papers college-level math homework).i got a free android app for annotating pdf's that i use to grade papers electronically having the stylus is indispensable for this purpose especially because it's very difficult to type mathematical symbols into any word processor one can use typesetting software but this is very impractical when you just want to grade papers.streaming video over wifi espn3 hbogo netflix works very well for plane rides the android video player works very well i have to convert some video files to mp4 but there is viable software on the internet cost-free to do this the battery has been more than sufficient for flying coast-to-coast unlike my old laptop's battery).i highly recommend the galaxy_note 8.0 i was a little concerned that the screen would be too small but i find it to be perfect for my purposes i like apple products very much but i don't think i would be as satisfied with an ipad for its lack of stylus and inflexibility with video playback and no i'm not converting back to windows or linux i still love my macbook and i'll get another when it dies 6 years and going\n",
      "i have had the galaxy_note 8.0 for a week now and decided to share my thoughts i come from a heavy ios/osx background owning ipad3,ipad mini and macbook air this is my first android tablet  i also own a sony xperia ray android phone but use it mainly as phone i also bought xperia tablet z recently and had to return due to build issues after few weeks  i won't get into specs or detailed reviews  there are quite a few good ones out there but will list out why i chose galaxy_note 8.0build  everyone is complaining about the plastic build of galaxy_note 8 it is actually very solid and has no squeaks the backplate gives a little when you push it however most will use a case to put their tablets so this is a non issue the white plastic looks classy also as this is plastic the wifi and bluetooth connections are solid i get min 4 bars even in bedroom with router in living room compared this to ipad mini barely went upto 2 bars sony xperia tablet z was terrible it dropped connections so often it was unusable  however not a big fan of where power button and vol buttons are  i would have preferred power button on top and vol button on left so when i hold tablet they don't get pressed accidentally as this tablet is designed to be held in portrait mode also love the physical home button  i think this because of habit i guess all apple devices have them   this tablet also weighs as much the ipad mini and xperia tablet z so it is very lightweight and easy to hold in one hand for long hrs.display  even though the display is 1280x800 the display is very crisp movies and pictures look really great and text looks real good at decent reading distance the display is way better than ipad mini but little bit lower than xperia tablet z which is 1080p however i prefer the galaxy_note 8.0 display as it is easy on eyes the colors popped so much on xperia tablet z it hurt my eyes small text  try msn.com website looks bit bad when you look closely  but you would never use tablet close to eyes anyways.battery life  i get about 2-3 days on single charge with moderate use browsing internet watching youtube some games etc mind you i keep brightness to 25  bluetooth and gps off  app notifications off this decent but not as good as ipad mini.sdxc card extension  this was the biggest sell for me i bought a sandisk 64 gb class 10 sd card and put about 40 movies on it and my books and i am all set for long trips none of the ipads have the feature.non propriety port the charge port is micro usb so with my universal usb charger i just need to carry one cable that will allow me to charge my mp3 player my tablet my cell phone and my portable amp as all use micro usb port reduced the clutter of cables i need to carry when i travelform factor  i was a big fan of ipad mini for its form factor i tried to use 10.1 inch tablet  sony xperia tablet z even though light became cumbersome after holding in hand for more than 30 mins the 7 inch is too small  10.1 inch too big  8 inches just perfect for both reading books and watching movies however i do prefer the 4:3 format of ipad mini vs 16:9 format of android tablets.multi tasking  this is brilliant feature and this device allows to have two applications next to each other  this is good when you want to take notes and when browsing a website or a doc  also the performance is so good there is zero lag even with 6 applications open in background ipad doesn't have true multi tasking and there was lag on sony xperia tablet z even though it is high powered device however that may be due to sony's bad skinning of jelly beanperformance/touch wiz  samsung has heavily skinned jelly bean with touch wiz however there is no lag as this tablet has gobs of power  the 2 gb ram and quad core processor keep this humming along i had sometimes 6 applications running in background which were cpu heavy but no lag or abrupt app closures with ipad mini apps sometime closed abruptly due to aggressive memory management ios is one of the best tuned os and uses the hw properly  android still needs horse power to run smoothly.speakers  they are placed in the same way it is on ipad mini i like that because when i watch movies in landscape mode the sound is more rounded as my palms cup them the are loud but not quite as loud as ipad mini but way better than the ones on sony xperia tablet z the sound is loud enough to hear in a noisy env i will not use the tablet for music as i have a very good sony mp3 player with amp  so the speakers are only for you tube videos or movies  mostly i will use headphones anywaysir blaster  imo this is just a gimmick the watch on and peel work for me only if i point my tablet at proper angle to the device it is controlling the app has so little features the one implemented on sony xperia tablet z is awesome it recognized all my ht components complex menu options and controlled them without me having to point the tablet accurately at the device  however i am hoping someone will come up with an awesome remote apps pen  this feature is new to me so i am completely fascinated by the tech it recognizes my handwriting well and i am using it regularly for my meetings  handwriting to text mode  need to play lot more with it but love the ability to do this  not many tablets have thisprice  i think it is reasonably priced  i bought mine for 379 for features and functions it provides people don't seem to mind exorbitant prices apple charges for their devices because they are cool   spen  sdxc extension touchwiz all makes this tablet worth every pennyecosystem and os  android os is not as polished as ios even in its current jelly bean format  however it is more fluid than ics as to apps there are quite a few now in play store that are designed for tablets luckily for me all the apps i use i found them in play store  also android is more open  so it allows me to manage my files the way i want and also root the device if i choose to it is open to other ecosystems like amazon market place so i am not tied down to a single ecosystem this is huge benefit as i was tired of apple restricting everything to itunescameras i will use them only for skype so no issue with the ones on the tablet will never use the back camera for taking pics so it doesn't matter to me what quality pics it takes however what ever pics i took for testing were decentthings i didn't like  the backbutton and multitask button are so sensitive that when watching movies i have accidentally swiped them and it went back to home page there is no easy way to disable this  also not a fan of the location of power button or vol rocker however the samsung galaxy book cover case is alleviating this a bit overall it is a very solid tablet filled with ton of features and at reasonable price(imo on a very flexible and open ecosystem  you just can't beat that also it is way better than ipad mini imo\n",
      "after almost 4 weeks worth of use:i will not comment more on anything else i have written about below suffice to say that battery life while excellent is still about 70 of what the ipad mini provides(i still get about 8 hours of continuous use and 16 hours of standby on average each day beyond that in all other aspects this has been a superior device(for me at least than the mini which i still carry around as a backup(mainly for tv shows,movies and when battery is low on the note why essentially because the screen resolution reminders and use of widgets far outclasses the ipad mini seriously if you currently have any kind of android smart phone and are familiar with the quirks buy the note 8 if you have an iphone and do not care about widgets and getting reminders/notifications that repeat can be autosnoozed and that you can actually hear...then stick with the mini.*quirks the note 8 and any android device can have battery drain while on standby if you do not tweak your settings and/or have poorly written apps downloaded my advice is to steer clear of free apps sponsored by ads since that is a major culprit buy the paid versions or do not download as to tweaking android settings there are many pages you can google depending on the version of android you have but this is a useful site size compared to nexus 7 i am hearing ad nauseum about how much better the nexus 7 is for the price well that is not valid in my opinion if only because the size of the two tablets is so different yes really even though the specs say only one inch difference there is a huge difference in viewing and clarity the note 8(like the ipad mini is the perfect balance between a 7 inch tablet which is too small to be useful for productivity and a 10 inch tablet which is too bulky and heavy comparisons in price should take this into account as well as the stylus,lack of sd card support on nexus 7 and the superior battery life(especially during standby of the note 8 comparing the nexus to the note is like comparing apples to iguanas a slight exaggeration perhaps but you get the point go into best buy to compare the note looks about 30 bigger compared to the nexus...it isn't but that is how much more comfortable it feels.update 8 on day 7 battery life one comment i received was that someone was having only 3-4 hours battery life just using the s-pen and no other app while s-pen is a battery hog that should still not be the case i have to specify that i only have my brightness settings set to 35-40%(more than adequate even for video and only turn on my gps if i need it for directions(i get at least 9 hours of continual use these two settings alone can easily double your battery life and is something i have automatically done on all my tablets for several years also i have only the sound notifications i need turned on-for example i do not need facebook ultimate todo etc and other notifications since my s3 smartphone handles those.again this makes a significant difference to battery life finally-the first day i received the note i used it down to less than 5 and then fully charges overnight despite any other advice you may hear i have always found a memory issue in batteries which is avoided by running down the battery as soon as you receive a device and fully charging it,then doing the same thing every few weeks battery life is always going to be subjective from person to person due to the difference in usage-but screen brightness,gps and notification settings are key factors for any user in preserving battery life on a mobile device.update 7 on day 6 one negative i do have is the amount of bloatware on the device 16gb became 9.8gb fine if you had 32gb to start off with...but since the only current model is 16gb that sucks anyway the good news is that even having downloaded 50 apps and hundreds of pics several smaller event videos and dozens of books i still have 7.8gb left does limit number of movies i can watch from google play-drm issue with not being able to move these to sd card i could root but in the past that has caused instability(especially after system updates so i do not do that anymore.i would be tempted to deduct half a star for the bloatware(google magazines allshare etc but some people do actually use these but they should just make them removable instead of system integrated titanium backup can help you remove these but again i do not really want to root but i knew this going in and did not want to wait for a 32gb model 90 of the time i do not need more than one or 2 movies on my device so i can live with that.oh i almost forgot the samsung keyboard has a feature you may not have noticed but let me back up a bit my favorite keyboard ever is swiftkey(on my galaxy 3 but i do not need it on this device since the built in keyboard does the same thing for predictions and learning etc(imho but also if you need to go back on what you have written to edit,you can just run your finger/stylus across the keyboard to scroll backwards or forwards up or down till you get to the area you wish to edit much simpler and faster than trying to pinpoint with the end of your finger/stylus i discovered this by accident even though it is in a user guide somewhere i later discovered.update 6 on day 5 the latest thing i have noticed but did not mention yet is the smart stay feature(under display settings default set to on it ensures that the screen never shuts off while you are looking at it so even if you have a 30 second screen timeout to save battery power(for when you glance quickly and then forget to turn off screen you can read uninterrupted it actually makes most sense to have a screen timeout of 1 minute for me i have found.also if there is a large amount of text on the screen and you have a one minute timeout the smart stay feature is phenomenal i had not commented on this before because i already use my samsung s3 and so take this feature for granted turning this off is a mistake since trust me you will use more power turning your screen on each time it times out otherwise.today i received over 80 emails read them and dozens of weather alerts and emergency alarms due to flooding around here this is about 4 times more in notifications than usual but no discernible increase in battery usage over the normal usage i have mentioned below i am going to do some intensive video watching over the next couple of days and post the results on battery life.update 5 on day 4 with the quad core processor on this it puts the nexus 7 to shame i can multitask at least 9 different apps with no noticeable lag or significant power drain i read another review say that they drained 30 of the battery after reading 10 of a book i read 30 of a book(150 real pages on kindle app in 2 hours with only 10 drain so it is not so much how many pages you read but the amount of time it takes you to read and the brightness setting don't get me wrong the ipad mini(only one you should compare to due to size of screen)has significantly better battery life but the note is up there with the best of the android tablets and i will certainly trade some battery power against getting customization and widgets.update 4 on day 4 i installed 7 more apps today-new york times,ultimate to-do,slice ap-memo data vault and a few others they were all optimized for tablets as compared to even a year ago when that was most definitely not the case with better resolution tablets and samsung increasing their tablet market closer and closer to 50 developers are churning out tablet optimized apps like crazy this will solve the only real issue i see with this tablet then samsung should bring out an amoled screen version of this device and with a higher resolution-something like 1900 x 1200 even though that will not be as high as the future retina display ipad mini the difference will not be noticeable a combination of a more user customizable operating system,more tablet apps and better resolution will(imho mean the ipad mini even with a retina display will get a run for the money also i would stress again that if you are going to browse the web a lot-definitely pick this(with firefox over the ipad mini why use a device that does not allow you to increase font size and be able to fit that to the screen i hate that about apple mobile products0their os does not currently work with textflow software.update 3 on day 4 battery life continues to be excellent i have discovered that the s-pen has an incredible utility even if you are not a student by pressing and holding on the microphone symbol next to the space bar on the samsung keyboard you get a box pop up with several icons clicking the one with a capital t and and a pen on it changes the input method in any app so that you have a scratchpad at the bottom to hand write this is then converted into text for longer emails or blogging this is very useful i also used it for shorter facebook comments and jotting down smaller notes my handwriting is not the best but with a little practice i was able to be 80 accurate on the longer notes and pretty much spot on for the one or two line notations i may not draw or take long lecture notes but the s-pen now had substantially higher value than originally thought also it hands down beats a regular stylus for responsiveness scrolling and smoothness it literally is an extension of your finger but with a much higher degree of accuracy and precision.update 2 this is really just to warn anyone reading the first review most helpful one listed that there is a comment there in the middle of the review that says the note is really fast to charge-in 1 hour that is not my experience and i cannot see how that would be possible unless the tablet is at 80 or something already or maybe if there are no apps apart from what are preloaded(though i cannot see that either which admittedly may be what the reviewer meant however i didn't read it that way and i think others might not either i got the charge down to 5%-at which stage certain protection protocols are built in(cannot be altered that i could find so the screen remained dim it took 3 hours with the unit fully shutdown to charge back to 100 just an fyi to anyone thinking that there is an amazing 1 hour charge time hope this helps.update 1 after 2 solid days of continual use i can say that the battery life is excellent in standby and while in use it loses less than 1 per hour on standby this is with wifi and gps continually running and updates for weather,email and other pim apps running in the background.i get 15 hours of use per day with 7 hours on standby and 8 used continually for web surfing reading app store and downloading apps.resolution is wonderful-screen angles superb at any angle better looking graphics than ipad mini nexus 7 and even pretty close to kindle hd-despite the kindle having much higher specs for resolution on paper at least samsung just make the best screens i would,as other users have commented not use this note for intensive gaming but rpg games run superbly and google play video looks just as good as anything the kindle hd 8.9 can provide-again specs are not everything samsung havedesigned their screems to maximize appearance and richness of video battery life when playing movies is great(compared to other android tablets),i was able to watch 3 movies lasting 5 hours and still be on 60 battery but i will test more since in my previous experience battery life runs down much faster when you get below 50 a quirk of the android operating system this is an area where apple still dominate with superior battery life more to follow in the days ahead.original review:fyi i got my device from best buy(barely 2 days ago and since i am a premier silver member i get 60 days to return.if you already use a samsung s3 then this will be the perfect accompaniment a very sleek fast and eye-catching device-get samsung's own smart cover for this since it is the best available currently at best buy(in white at my store if you want the slimmest,lightest case that does not cover the bezel(my preference only).i essentially got this to be able to read my blogs and news articles surf the web track calender,reminders to do lists i can do this on the s3 but this way i get to save my eyesight a lot more which suddenly has become an issue in my mid forties i also have an ipad mini which i love-but on any ipad device there is an issue of hearing the alarms customizing sounds and changing snoozes auto snoozing and generally having nagging reminders there are some apple apps that can help but not many to choose from android does not have that issue because of the open source operating system so i use the ipad mini for portability,surfing reading,email,video facebook and games and my s3 smart phone for all the reminders and tasks etc-they still sync onto my ipad mini but i hear the alarms and get the nagging reminders on my phone the galaxy_note 8 now lets me have the reminders,surf the web with a better firefox browser that has text reflow for virtually any site shop read and take a few handwritten notes excellently(facebook app is awful on android-feria on ipad mini is a dream unlike other reviewers the s-pen is only useful in a minor way for me since i am not at college or studying all the other benefits listed above make this worth it for me on their own one of the best things is the use of the firefox app-being able to turn almost any page into easily read text format only with adjustable font,is priceless when so much time is spent on the web as is the ease of which you can zoom in on any page and the text will reflow to the larger font and fit the screen(also syncing my desktop web bookmarks and history essential but something no decent browser on apple devices can successfully accomplish-so on my apple devices i tend to use flipboard taptu zite and other rss readers to fulfill the news functions.the reason i am deducting one star is threefold the price should be 350 to match the ipad mini(the only real competitor to this product imho there are not that many android apps truly optimized for android tablets-unlike apple and the s-pen still does not have its incredible usefulness shown because there are only a handful of apps written for it i deduct only 1 star for all 3 since the s-pen is not the main reason i got this tablet and with software updates/more apps on the way i know this will change-so i deducted only a quarter star for this a quarter star for the price but half a star for android not having more tablet optimized apps gaming is something i do rarely,but i find the ipad mini my s3 to be excellent for that since the battery life is phenomenal on the mini especially i will write more about battery life on the note watching movies etc when i have used it a few more days i certainly am glad that i purchased at this moment however and hope this helps everyone who is considering but confused by so many tablets out there right now.if this has been helpful or not please vote accordingly i usually answer any comments within a day or so when testing out tablets-which is something i do as a partially paid amateur hobby.i have owned or tested virtually all tablets released in north america over the last 4

      "i've had the galaxy_note 8 for a little over a month now and i have to say i love it its perfect in so many ways.i'm a full-time musician  part-time pc tech and the gn8 is helpful in both of these aspects.the s note app allows me to create folders to help organize where everything is the android os allows me to have access to my evernote  google drive accounts which comes in very handy.the musician:when working on new songs i now simply open up an idea note on the gn8 write down the chords lyric ideas  take a little video of me playing the song  embed it into the same note so a few days later when i want to revisit the song i just need to open on that one note to help me continue from where i left.the pc tech:i take lots of notes especially when it comes to new problems or obscure issues so writing or typing down my notes of the problem  the solution provides me a quick way to resolve the issue if or when it happens in the future.due to my double life i have different email addresses the built in email program is brilliant it supports multiple emails from different carries so i have both my gmail accounts  my godaddy accounts at a tap of finger.it gives you the option of viewing all the emails at once or you can pick and choose which email you want to see.and the delete all feature is a godsend when i want to clear out my inbox i don't have to choose every single email anymore i just to options and say delete all its brilliant.the s pen is the real selling feature it allows me to take notes draw diagrams or just doodle when i'm watching tv also i've downloaded the kobo app which turns the gn8 into an awesome ereader the size is perfect for reading books.the 3 major difference i've noticed between the gn8  the gn10 are three things:#1 the size#2 the s pen is smaller than that of the gn10#3 gn8 doesn't have an led flash for the back camera.honestly those were not a deal breaker for me the camera quality is ok but you have to keep in mind that the device is not intended to be a camera it is much much more than that its like a dream catcher for creativity.i had the gn10 it was a great device but it was too big for my liking.if your looking for something with a great camera then this is not for you.if your an active person who has bursts of creativity  would like to capture it at a moments notice then this is the device for you.i hope that helps much love\n",
      "galaxy_note 8.0 review.very good tablet but falls short in some critical ways.i like the size and i find it the most functional tablet next to my galaxy_note 10.1 except for some critical flaws that made me decide to return it.1 bad baattery don't know if i got a defective unit but the battery life is unacceptable for my use there was likely something wrong with the unit but if there's something i can't stand in a mobile device it's poor battery life)2 16gb of internal storage just doesn't cut it for me without installing a single game or storing a single picture or music or movie i was beginning to run out of space just after installing most of my apps that i actually use and yes i have an sd card but everyone not living under a rock knows that since ics android no longer supports a2sd and heck no i have no intention of hacking and switching my external sd for internal sd been there done that and all the resulting problems are not what i have the time to deal with)the above issues were the biggest problems with it.other things i would change are:1 higher resolution screen with excellent sunlight legibility2 make it even lighter3 better robust speakers4 add flash to the camera and equip it with better camerasi think if you get a unit without a bad battery this would be really functional assuming you'll not be installing a lot of apps on it i don't think you'll find any tablet right now that offers the utility in terms of taking notes and just being productive besides the note 10.1 if you don't mind the size).it's sad i'll be returning it maybe if the battery was good i'd have kept it and lived with the restrictive memory.for now i'll stay away from every tablet or phone with anything less than 32gb of internal storage btw when your internal storage drops to about 2.5gb your phone or tablet will begin to lag this is the cause of lag in a lot of devices keep you internal storage at about 3.5gb and you'll likely see no lag\n",
      "this is my personal review as a female middle-aged not-so-tech-savvy user the new note 8.0 is very similar to the galaxy_note 10.1 that i have been using at work and love that was why even with the price i chose to buy this the minute it was released i also own an ipad 3 and a kindle fire hd so i have experience with all of them the size of this was a big bonus as it it much easier for dropping in my purse and hitting the road i chose this over the ipad mini because of the expandable memory and the s pen it was a slam dunk because i also wanted work functions that i don't feel i have with my regular ipad this is an entertainment tablet as well as a very functional work tool the s pen is the major draw...and be careful to not lose it because replacements are pricey.i love the ease and function of the s pen and considering the price i am pleased that it tucks away so neatly and stays securely i have misplaced it twice so it is just a matter of time until i have to replace it...however it doesn't feel as though it will ever just fall out on its own i really love it because it feels like using a real pen and the handwriting is actually my handwriting taking notes or just jotting things down is much easier on this than on my ipad it is much clearer and a simpler function the pen feels much more natural too i have that rubber-nub ended pen for the ipad and the s pen by far is superior.it is slightly larger obviously than my kindle fire hd 7...but that inch makes a huge difference when reading and watching videos it doesn't feel any more cumbersome than the kindle they are both very sturdy and feel well built my son will now inherit the kindle hd as this is replacing it the note fulfills almost all of the entertainment functions of the kindle with obviously greater functions for work the main function i will miss on the kindle is the prime video streaming app from amazon amazon has made the app available to ipad and the kindles but no other android device update a helpful soul directed me to download xscope from google play and the flash player in that browser works great with amazon videos be sure to set your security to allow apps from other sources at least during the first run with the browser because it sets up flash from the adobe site directly.the expandable memory is a big deal for me and i immediately put in a 64gb memory card samsung warns that a 64 gb memory card may cause instability and that 32 is the biggest recommended i've experienced no instability yet and will update if i do i store and play a lot of music and videos with my note the internal speaker is acceptable but not awesome the sound on the kindle is much higher quality as far as the internal speaker is concerned the headphone jack is loud and clear i hook into my car speakers and use this as a video device gps and music player i also use it for audiobooks with the audible app that app is slightly different than the ipad version but equally as functional and kind of more sleek in how it operates.the screen is crystal clear and beautiful the s pen is a bonus here too as well fewer fingerprints watching videos and taking pictures is a pleasure the camera takes great pictures the camera is comparable to the kindle hd7 but not to the ipad front and rear facing cameras...the one in the back seems to take better still shots i guess the screen isn't as great as my ipad but i have to admit that i can't tell the difference that may be because this screen is so small or because my eyes are 43 years old and nothing looks all that clear anymore.kindle and ebook reader app differences i didn't notice this at first but someone asked about it so i checked there is a significant difference in the appearance of reading ebooks between this and the note 10.1 this is much softer looking like real paper it seems to be much easier on the eyes and i believe will make a significant difference in how tired my eyes feel after reading for any extended period it is a nice improvement\n",
      "since i love my galaxy_note 2 and i am an s pen user i wanted my next tablet to be a note 8.0 a factory refurb for under 200 sealed the deal i was disappointed that the 8.0 did not have some of the simple features of my note 2 no led notification light when you have a message/email/etc no s pen keeper which sounds an alert and shows a pop up when you walk away with your device without attaching the s pen none of the cool writing features where for example you make a written mistake and you can cross a line through it to delete the text or draw a line between letters to make a space on the 8 you have to erase the entire word using the back button also the s pen on the 2 pops out easily when you push it the 8 requires you to really dig it out of its hole perhaps most of this can be fixed with a simple android version upgrade mine is 4.2.2)the good stuff unlike the note 2 the s pen does work with the settings and return buttons at the bottom of the tablet on the note 2 you have to press it with your finger which is a pain with pen in hand the s pen is slightly longer on the 8.0 which makes it easier to write the larger space to write has really helped my accuracy and has me more interested in s notes it boots up quickly and is very responsive the size is perfect for portability though a tad heavier than i anticipated particularly for using the pen while holding it the picture is sharp though i am still prefer my kindle book when reading books.overall i am very happy with the tablet and i hope the next android software upgrade will bring some of the features i love in my note 2\n",
      "i was on the fence about this device but the in depth reviews on amazon convinced me to give it a try i have owned the galaxy_note 8 for over a month and can find no major fault with it i was consdering the ipad mini 2 but since i own a galaxy_s2 and other samsung tablets i went with samsung instead i prefer the more open android platform to apples closed tightly controlled devices.the screen is very bright and its quad core processer provides a very snappy response i am getting 8 to 9 hours battery life by adjusting the wifi radio to shut off when in standby mode.i did have problems with the 25 google play credit but contacted samsung support on facebook i received my credit within 24 hours i also went with the box.com free 50 gb cloud service because there is no time limit too many hoops to jump through with dropbox.this is a tablet for productivity great for students business people and anyone wishing to organize their ideas.i am currently using the poetic slim case which offers good protection without a lot of bulk i have odered the s pen with eraser as a second pen for note taking.it is unfortunate that amazon prime movies will not play on this tabet even with the adobe flash apk only movie trailers will play it has to do with adobe drm protection i can watch movies with hbogo but not maxgo.also i am using vudu and flixster to watch my movies vudu will do disc to digital conversionfor 2.so i can watch my movies anytime in the cloud!sorry i am unable to edit the double sentance below!i am very happy with my galaxy_note 8 and i hope everyone else has a similar experiene!well i am very happy with my sgn8 and i hope everyone else enjoys their sgn8 asmuch\n",
      "when looking at smaller-than-9-inch tablets it really comes down to the samsung galaxy_note 8.0 and the google nexus 7 2013).both devices have enough ram and cpu power to run practically any app or game.the samsung note 8.0 has a few pros and conspros:8 inchwacom digitizer and stylus for drawing and handwritingsamsung's split screen multitasking mode that allows you to run 2 apps at the same timesd card for storage expansioncons:not as high res as the new nexus 7 and it's an inch bigger so that even lower pixel density not a big deal for me i have never had an issue reading anything on this screen and video still looks great.much more expensiveslower to get updates the wifi version just got 4.2 not really an issue since most android updates now come through the play store service.has a dedicated 34;menu&#34 button instead of an app switch button a dedicated menu button means that you never know when a menu button is actually going to do something where as an onscreen menu button only shows up when it has a function all samsung devices are built this way and it is a poor design decision.samsung touchwiz is kind of ugly but you can install your own launcher and you will never see it outside of the system menu and notification shade.so for me the biggest drawback was the price difference i purchased mine and my wife note 8.0 tablets as referbs and they work great but if you have to buy new i think the price difference makes the nexus 7 a better buy\n",
      "if you don't have a strong need for an active stylus this tablet isn't worth the price on the other hand if you plan on writing digitally it's perfect i use it for all my notes and homework at university i've never had any complaints about performance or battery life in fact i rarely get it below 50 in a day the stylus is very accurate the size seems perfect for a tablet much bigger and i might as well use my laptop but any smaller and it would be hard to use it even fits in my coat pocket all the samsung junk is a bit annoying but you can disable most of the things through the application manager in settings.some tips if you want to use it for taking notes i find the app lecturenotes the most capable android application for note-taking the full version is 5 i think but when you just bought a 300 tablet what's another 5 it easily lets you import pdfs to write on and you can export as pdf to print to share by using another application called dropsync it will sync all your notes to dropbox which you get an extra 50gb from buynig this tablet viewable on your computer i bought a separate stylus to make long writing sessions more comfortable it's the 34;bamboo stylus feel for samsung galaxy_note&#34 be sure you get the one with the product code cs300uk2 not cs300uk because it will not write accurately it's only available from wacom's website\n",
      "coming from owning the galaxy_note ii which i love i was looking forward to getting the 8&#34 i like it a lot except that many time it freezes in the middle of doing something requiring that i restart it.the camera for pictures is quite good the video not so much good that i can take excellent pictures with the note.ii so i will use them if i have no other camera around.everything else i enjoy it since no other tablet offers the possibilities this one does\n",

      "scheduling device this is my second galaxy_note 8 device as the first device arrived with defects and was returned however,i decided to give the note 8 another chance and i'm glad i did.for several years i've been searching for a suitable device that would enable me to plan and track various events in my life prior to owning the note 8 i've tried just about every tablet available imho this is the first tablet that has really brought all the processes together on one device for me.if you're the type of person who likes to plan out to the extent we can every thing in your life including plan b  c then the note 8 just might be just the device for you everything you'll need is on the device or available for download.be prepared for an interesting journey of learning about the note 8 and how you can make it work for you.the battery life despite using all the various tricks to make it last longer could certainly be improved by samsung but i manage and so will you.otherwise the note 8 is also a great web hopper e-reader and entertainment device i'm not a gamer as we speak so i can't comment regarding potential gaming ability.and lest i forget that giant hulk hogan toothpick that comes with the note 8 is a blast to use and play with!for the money and all the capabilities that the note 8 comes with i believe it's a purchase that you will not regret.update for 15 sept 2013unfortunately my galaxy_note 8 started having difficulties with extremely poor battery life overheating and dropping wifi signals there were other intermittent problems as well and these are some of the same problems i experienced with the first galaxy_note 8.ups is picking up the note on monday for return and i'm back to relying on my first gen kindle fire hd i'll take another look at the next cycle of samsung note products next year i guess\n",
      "i've had it for 2 days and it just works great i've installed a 64gib card with ease this tablet is just damn near perfect its got that one size fits all factor wether you like browsing or reading you can do it comfortably taking notes is just a breeze honestly the screen is gorgeous and its got 189ppi so between this and the nooks or ipads i'd still go.with the galaxy_note because i can't differentiate between them the note is better than the nook as it just works out of the box you don't need to waste your time trying to put cyanogenmod unlike the nook the galaxy_has a great os i thought i would hate touchwiz but honestly i actually like it sketchbook pro works amazing i don't know what else to say all of my humble bundle android games work if i ever need the cameras maybe they'll come in useful but i'm glad i do have them battery life is something i need to come back and update but it looks ok for now i seriously don't know how much more i can praise it sure its 70 bucks more than the ipad and if you want the note features and the ability to draw and expand the memory id say get the note i'm really happy with it\n",
      "samsung galaxy_note 8.0 is great tablet i choose it over the apple mini tablet i very happy with it\n",
      "i ended up buying this from a different vendor because amazon was taking too long to ship it to me so i returned theirs when it finally came besides i got it at a lower price from the other vendor this thing is overkill for what i'll be using it for at least for now but i love the look feel and functionality of it the 8 inch screen is the perfect size for me i have a 10-inch samsung tablet that works great but i no longer use it because its too big to hold for long or to carry around the galaxy_note 8.0 is not perfect and the price should be a bit lower for the features it has but i haven't experienced any of the issues that some people are complaining about and i don't regret buying it i'm going to buy two more of them as gifts for my sisters\n",
      "i have a new ipad an ipad mini and a galaxy_note ii compare it to those electrics it is not good to recommend to others the galaxy_note 8.0 has very poor screen quality compare to an ipad mini especially when you watching movies even compare to galaxy_note ii the screen quality is bad also the galaxy_note 8.0 is very slow even compare to galaxy_note ii you really need patient to waiting when you using most of apps i am using the galaxy_note 8.0 with same apps as my galaxy_note ii the galaxy_note 8.0 has at least twice slow than the galaxy_note ii also i cannot adjust the touch screen although it always activated one line above my touch\n",
      "really i mean why samsung put this price with only 16gb no phone feature and even no cellular it is overpriced product maybe it has a little bit faster cpu and higher screen resolution but not worth the money right now galaxy_note 10.1 is 449 why samsung still selling this note 8 with this price there is nexus 7 in the market already and it is only 200 even ipad mini is 329 compare the price rate with apple ipad 4 499 ipad mini 329 even ipad2 399 there is 170 differences between ipad 4 and ipad mini and 70 between ipad2 and mini in note8 there only 50 differences with note10.1  come on it should be 300 to 350 i have note 10.1 and i compared with note 8 this morning actuary there is no differences between these two tabs only the size sure it is smaller easy to carry but there is no phone feature and no cellular in this price i would like to buy the bigger screen for home use\n",
      "the best extra money i almost didn&#8217;t spend for a refurbished item.&#8226 the bad:o touch wizo s-voiceo potentially damaging magnetic interference&#61607 note none of these negatives impacted the overall score of the samsung galaxy_note 8.0 because all of them have simplesolutions.&#8226 the mediocre:o price&#61607 note this caused no negative impact on the overall score because there are plenty of solutions to this problem as follows).&#8226 the good:o the next few thousand words.summary the samsung galaxy_note 8 gn8 is to multimedia professionals what a swiss army knife is to macgyver.bonus edition material all the applications and accessories you need to kick some serious multi-media tail in the field with the gn8 for next to nothing.before i start swooning over this tablet like tony did maria in west side story i&#8217;m going to get started with the things i don&#8217;t like at all about the gn8:the bad:touchwiz is a problem it&#8217;s a bloated and unnecessary launcher while samsung has toned down some of the fischer-price 8220;my first tablet&#8221 icons a bit i still don&#8217;t like manufacturer launchers of any kind&#8230 nor do most users optimize the standard android os for your hardware allow for direct updates and let the user tailor their experience to their liking hint that&#8217;s why people buy android.i&#8217;ve installed nova launcher prime because it&#8217;s fast highly customizable can use most icon packs from adw and go if you&#8217;re into that sort of thing and allows me to run my entire tablet from a single home screen and well-organized app drawer.[...]s-voice is a problem it&#8217;s not siri it&#8217;s not vlingo it&#8217;s not google now it&#8217;s not as integrated as samsung thinks and it&#8217;s not good the solution is simple as all you have to do is use google now while s-voice does plug in to the samsung apps very well the problem is that the samsung apps aren&#8217;t as good as what they&#8217;re designed to replace.the words of jesse pinkman allude to a serious problem 8220;magnets bitches!&#8221 often found in 8220;smart covers&#8221 that automatically wake up your tablet they automatically destroy the gn8&#8217;s magnetically-driven hardware that allow the s-pen to work so well they create dead-spots in the screen.the solutions are many find a cover that uses weak magnets which is to say spend the extra money on the oem cover for the same price as the oem cover purchase the protection overkill of the otterbox defender case made for the gn8 hunt for a case that doesn&#8217;t use magnets and still offers good protection.the mediocre:the price is another problem at 399 it&#8217;s pretty steep for a small tablet not running ios or windows 8rt both of which are much more integrated into the professional environment the gn8 is designed to serve while the s-pen is incredible and its integration makes it a steal when compared to the thousand dollars you have to shell out for a surface pro most people aren&#8217;t the kind of users that will actually get a value-added experience with it my suggestion is to go with the n7.2&#8230 or galaxy 3 tab 8.0&#8221 which still comes with great perks and allows you to control your tv more on this later).granted the gn8 comes with a ton of perks as long as you buy it by 30 september 2013  and it is on sale at staples for 329.99 at least it was when i wrote this review).there is also another price work-around to be considered buying refurbished at 299.99 you get all the perks of the special promotion and you don&#8217;t have to pay sales tax it&#8217;s used by the time i factored in all the tax savings and perks i paid a bit less for a gn8 than i would have for the only other affordable tablet that could meet my needs the second-generation asus nexus 7 n7.2).this isn&#8217;t your typical 8220;used car&#8221 version of a refurbished item the packaging is complete the device looks great and honestly&#8230 in my experience the failure rate for factory-refurbished equipment has been lower than that of new equipment.not to mention it&#8217;s better for the environment and the domestic economy when you consider samsung does their refurbishing right here in the united states.you get a decent 90-day warranty you can extend if you want to i root every android device i buy which voids most warranties so this isn&#8217;t a major concern for me you pay your pennies and you take your chances.by the time everything was tallied up i purchased a refurbished gn8 spare chargers both for a car and ac wall charging an otg micro usb to usb adapter more on that later a folding bluetooth keyboard a case and chromecast for only 15 more than i would have paid for the gn8 alone with california sales tax at my local staples.in-depth the 96hr immersionthe last four days have seen my experience evolve from fascination to ham-fisted frustration to my girlfriend literally being pulling me away from the tablet by my ear because of blood-blasted 8220;blood-shot doesn&#8217;t begin to describe it eyes to now at this present time actually feeling an emotional connection similar to the one i feel with my lovely and well-trained dogs.samsung has come a long way with their packaging over the last decade coming close to the unboxing experience apple products have soiled the electronics market with i know that the 8220;recycled&#8221 materials a bit of propaganda but i like the message the propaganda sends.the first thing i noticed is that the gn8 feels as good in the hand as it looks in the box it really is a beautiful device taking full advantage of the slick design that has made samsung&#8217;s galaxy line so successful it is much lighter than the solid feeling tells the sense of touch it should be and is a very high-quality product when it comes to materials and finish however the back is a little too slick to use without having anxiety over dropping it but a person that uses a tablet without a case probably has advanced-stage syphilis as well&#8230 and aren&#8217;t worth knowing.i&#8217;ve read some reviews that have attacked the use of polycarbonate for the body saying it feels cheap there are no signs of poor build quality in this tablet the same can be said for the gn8&#8217;s most significant competitor the n7.2 both feel solid without feeling chunky.as far as durability is concerned it should be noted that polycarbonate is used in things like safety glasses and bullet-proof windows for a reason it&#8217;s strong and can take a beating metal is cool and feels good but it also dents and arcs destroying delicate electronics the gn8 is also built with the second generation of corning&#8217;s gorilla glass so durability of the device itself should be excellent.the same can&#8217;t be said for the metal foil laminate of the bezel around the gn8s camera in back which is already starting to chip a bit from setting it on my desk when charging samsung should have used the same material they did around the perimeter of the gn8&#8217;s shell.when combined with a portable bluetooth keyboard a must if you&#8217;re serious about getting the most out of your tablet purchase the entire package comes in at roughly a pound.this has been a blessing because my typical load for a day in the field includes the following a dslr with two lenses assorted filters an extra battery and usb hdmi and component cables a prosumer point and shoot with an extra battery a stereo microphone with pop filter and table-top tripod usb cable a portable solar panel eight rechargeable aa batteries to run my mic mobile phone flashlights a portable scanner the gn8 should it actually run out of power and a steripen water purifier sometimes when i write that i 8220;work in the field,&#8221 i&#8217;m being literal assorted equipment to clean and maintain my camera equipment pens markers highlighters and a notepad a simple grooming and first/last aid kit it&#8217;s important to make sure fingernails and calluses are taken care of when meeting clients a waiter&#8217;s wine opener chapstick gum because it&#8217;s important to be able to celebrate a new acquaintance whenever you meet her condoms because i&#8217;m an optimist a cigarette lighter for what comes after the bottle of wine a flashlight a head light the aforementioned scanner and water purifier my glasses cables and power adapters for my phone and gn8 bluetooth headsets a kobo glo with a few hundred books on it nothing will ever replace e-ink a pair of gloves a small knife a pair of gloves a small tripod two liters of water and before getting the gn8 a bit seven pound laptop 1.5 pound spare battery and a one-pound charging brick&#8230 all packed into a strained assembly of water-resistant fabric that is considered a 8220;personal carry-on item&#8221;!most of this equipment is used at least two or three times a week even the water purifier when i&#8217;m hiking or don&#8217;t trust the tap water and i only want to eat shower and dress in the morning so doing a different load-out every day is impractical.what i&#8217;ve found over the last week is that i can do about 95 of what i need to do when i need to do it with the gn8&#8230 and it has taken my typical load-out from a shoulder and back abusing 28 pounds to a 8220 comfortably feather-weight&#8221 17.5!relevant luggage tangent while a backpack would carry my daily load more comfortably satchels are mandatory for quickly accessing photography gear also the faa lists backpacks as 8220;luggage,&#8221 whereas a satchel as long as it fits within the maximum allowable size is considered a personal item akin to a purse or briefcase regardless how much it weighs.the display which is slightly larger by the ruler than the n7.2&#8217;s is wonderful once it&#8217;s been optimized for text and reading understand that it is a two-step process to make the gn8&#8217;s screen really earn its praise first turn on 8220;reading mode&#8221 in the drop-down settings menu then go into device settings under the display submenu and check the box that optimizes the display for text it makes reading mode an enjoyable experience rather than a gimmick.with those tweaks the display is so good i actually prefer the gn8 to the n7.2 when it comes to reading flipbook and pdfs&#8230 but i&#8217;ll still be using my kobo glo for long periods of reading e-books.for gamers the gn8 may not have the pixel saturation of the n7.2&#8217;s tremendous display but it isn&#8217;t lacking about as heavy into gaming as i get is bard&#8217;s tale and it looks and plays great on the gn8 with the high-definition graphics pack more intense games will make the gn8 stutter a bit as its graphics processor is a bit dated however you&#8217;re not going to be interested in the gn8 if you&#8217;re only looking to browse the internet play games and stream movies this is not your recreational user&#8217;s tablet.there&#8217;s also a price to be paid for the n7.2&#8217;s cutting edge technology glitches google it.in addition to an enjoyable reading experience the gn8 has something the n7.2 should physical buttons that eliminate the need of assigning precious screen real-estate to navigation icons these physical keys located away from the screen make the actual display area of the gn8 about 20 larger than the n7.2 with its virtual keys that take up a significant chunk of room on the display samsung like apple gets why people instinctually enjoy having a dedicated home button it makes life easier even if some technophiles consider them the cumbersome tools of luddites the dedicated keys make a lot of sense on the gn8 if you&#8217;re interested in a device that has been designed around a stylus you appreciate the touch-feely attributes of the entire galaxy line&#8217;s design.that stylus is a major benefit for people like me content publishers that need to be able to import edit and publish multimedia from remote locations while sketching is great for fun or to make mind maps of projects the s-pen isn&#8217;t just about paper artist i&#8217;ve found very good uses for the s-pen when paired with the gn8&#8217;s impressive hardware.the s-pen is a great device and i understand why people justify the expense of the gn8 with the statement 8220;it&#8217;s all about the s-pen&#8221 after using the n7.2 with an aftermarket device the s-pen is a bit too thin for me to use for long periods but i actually prefer navigating around the home screen and most applications with the s-pen instead of my finger especially photoshop touch more on that later).this isn&#8217;t a major problem because the note is designed to take&#8230 notes the s-pen integrates well when digesting information-heavy pdfs allowing the user to highlight section of text make notes and quickly integrate and organize them within s-note.making the process even more efficient is multiwindow the multiwindow feature is one of the advantages unique to the note line that samsung has made better than in the last generation with smoother control and more available applications that support it of course i would like to see even more applications support it because everyone uses multiple windows on their bigger computers so everyone knows how much of a productivity advantage the capability is it&#8217;s a no-brainer application designers need to integrate into their apps.when a beautiful display optimized for reading and highly integrated to the s-pen input and interface then empowered with multiwindow and gestures like swiping the screen with the flat of the hand to take a full screen shot or circling text and images with the s-pen&#8217;s button depressed to capture smaller items i have a hard time believing that any other device could be better for the task of heavy research and study the gn8 is the honors graduate student&#8217;s wet dream.and there&#8217;s good news for gn8 users after grad school to schedule life s-planner almost became what i use to work with my google calendars it&#8217;s a fluid and seamless way to do almost everything i need to do with my schedules but it has one glaring fault because instead of being its own application s-planner is not much more than google calendar with s-pen support and a new skin unfortunately s-planner has all the limitations of google calendar when it comes to scheduling.instead i&#8217;m using another pre-loaded gn8 application for most of my scheduling needs awesome note hd though i still prefer the endless scrolling agenda list of business calendar&#8217;s widget found here https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=netgenius.bizcal&hl;=en awesome note hd like the now-dead astrid allows me to set repeating events by the days that need to elapse granted this is a feature i use to do things like remind myself to change the house&#8217;s hvac filter replace the head on my electric toothbrush and give my lovely dog her heartworm and tick medications while pedestrian all of those tasks are dependent on the amount of days lapsed and important to me.note to samsung form a partnership with awesome note by folding s-planner and s-note into a note-tablet specific version of their application.the gn8 is loaded with a 4,600mah battery that keeps me moving and producing in the field for my entire day in the week i&#8217;ve had it i have never have to recharge the gn8 before bedtime and i&#8217;m not a light user.this is my gn8&#8217;s typical day i start out by sending and responding to emails in the morning for about an hour during my commute generally using a folding bluetooth keyboard or google&#8217;s voice recognition input through a bluetooth headset once i get to where i&#8217;m going my day is spent capturing and creating content editing content between meetings and giving presentations at my client&#8217;s offices on my way home i participate in social networking play video games or try to get ahead on media projects that are either rushed delayed or personal after my commute i&#8217;ll use the gn8 to manage shopping and errand lists on my way home and once i get home i use the integrated peel application to control my television and directtv!speaking of the ir blaster it won&#8217;t allow you to 8220;bump&#8221 files and contacts to other devices like the n7.2&#8217;s nfc feature some have listed this as a detriment but nfc isn&#8217;t going to be used in the environment that the gn8 is designed to excel in professionals may bump contacts with their phones but i&#8217;ve never seen anyone do it with their tablet&#8230 and i&#8217;ve seen a lot of people use a lot of tablets.however with the ir blaster found on the gn8 and not the n7.2 it is a tremendous asset to be able to control monitors and most other devices with the same device you&#8217;re running a presentation from with chromecast and the ir blaster found in the gn8 i&#8217;m ready to rock a presentation in most modern offices within a minute&#8230 and that makes a great impression when dealing with prospective clients that don&#8217;t have a lot of time to waste.that&#8217;s not to say nfc isn&#8217;t good technology it&#8217;s great on a phone but i&#8217;m not going to dig out my tablet every time i want to purchase a latte and apple fritter&#8230;the samsung galaxy_note 8 is a 8220;force multiplier&#8221 for media professionals because you buy a whole lot of bangs with the same buck when the ability to set up and control presentation equipment in seconds instead of minutes or even hours with older stuff is combined with a massive fuel tank that supports a full work day of use without a recharge outstanding performance high-speed connectivity better productivity a wonderful display light weight and a slick design the gn8 becomes more than a really cool tablet the gn8 does most of what any mobile professional needs it to do for as long as they need it to do it while saving weight money time and with the s-pen it also saves my clients from the indignity of signing my invoices with their finger.the bonus edition:this is what you spend the 25 google play credit on if you want to get the most out of the gn8&#8217;s unique features that make this tablet the best small android tablet on the market:the s-pen and adobe&#8217;s 10 8220;limited&#8221 port of photoshop  go together like peanut butter and jelly i know that there are capable applications out there like snapseed that will allow most people to do almost everything they need to make their photos pop for facebook and pinterest but i&#8217;m not blogging about food trucks or touching up selfies i do stuff with images video and sound for a living if i can have photoshop and do the high quality creating and editing on the go i&#8217;m buying it&#8230 and honestly it&#8217;ll do at least 95 of what i need it to do so when compared to the exponentially more expensive desktop application photoshop touch is one of the century&#8217;s best deals.in addition to that a 4.99 license for clesh  gives me the ability to edit videos on the go it works well for most of my needs though some more complicated projects still require my sedentary equipment because i don&#8217;t have much patience i wouldn&#8217;t recommend clesh for a smartphone but on larger displays and the extremely fast wifi radio built into the gn8 clesh is a wonderful application that makes the most of the gn8&#8217;s hardware and s-pen.to round it all out audio evolution mobile is available for 6.99  and allows me to connect my zoom audio recorder to the gn8 via an inexpensive otg usb adapter it captures much better audio than the microphones mounted on the gn8 and it allows me to capture edit and package complete audio tracks while working from my couch or on the long metro ride home the s-pen makes grabbing and piecing together tracks one of the easiest experiences i&#8217;ve had and i have complete control over the entire capture process when doing podcasts outside my normal studio.compared to the desktop interface i prefer to edit my audio on the gn8 for a few reasons first is the s-pen interface because it makes clicking and scrolling and dragging so much more fluid than the mouse the second reason has to do with quality i can listen to it through my car&#8217;s audio jack or bluetooth through wired headphones bluetooth stereo and bluetooth mono headsets this allows me to make sure it sounds okay across all formats my audience is likely to use without having to suffer the indignity of microsoft&#8217;s bluetooth client.since i have an otg cable i need an app that will help me bring files to the gn8 from its native location and that&#8217;s the excellent nexus media importer available at the play market for 3.99  if i don&#8217;t have to hassle with swapping microsd i don&#8217;t hassle with swapping microsd cards and i&#8217;ve already paid myself back a few times with the amount of time and frustration this application saves me.to get all those files organized and uploaded to where they need to go i use the total commander file manager  and the ftp plugin for total commander  both are available for free at the android market and are the best applications i&#8217;ve used for my needs.for those not keeping track the above applications cost a total of 25.96 and make the gn8 one of the best editing platforms i&#8217;ve ever used so far i haven&#8217;t witnessed the 1.6ghz quad-core exynos processor struggle with the demands of editing or creating professional-level multimedia content even if it is slower than a high-quality desktop i save more time with the s-pen than i&#8217;ve wasted on rendering.if i need to access a more powerful system samsung and dropbox have teamed up to give gn8 purchasers a free 50gb upgrade the wifi radio that comes with the gn8 is one of the fastest i&#8217;ve used and i&#8217;ve moved large files over both public and private hotspots in about the same amount of time my laptop takes granted this is a snail&#8217;s pace when compared to a direct line into a cable network but for wifi performance the gn8&#8217;s performance impresses.also the gn8 has one of the best gps radios i&#8217;ve used on any device navigating with gn8 and google now takes about 15 seconds less than trying to do the same thing through the dedicated navigation systems i&#8217;ve used in most cars it is truly amazing how much work samsung put into getting the gn8 to work well before releasing it to market.you can&#8217;t say the same thing about the n7.2 google it.combined with splashtop all i have to do is upload the media to my dropbox account log into the app wait for my desktop to pop up and tell my hard-core unit at home what to do while i&#8217;m meeting with clients doing work or commuting my bigger projects are rendering on their own i can log back in to splashtop to check the progress of the project from anywhere in the united states and when it&#8217;s done i can use splashtop to send it back to dropbox and have my client preview it.techno-tangent warning even though it&#8217;s more difficult to set up i prefer the older splashtop remote desktop hd on sale for 8.99 because i can use it any time i want on any network i want without having to 8220;rent&#8221 it by the month pad if programming settings is too difficult or you find google&#8217;s servers too slow for things like gaming you can use the new and improved splashtop2 \n",
      "i had to return this tablet mainly because of the cost/benefit ratio had it been 100 cheaper i would have kept operating it is no different than the galaxy_note 2 almost the exact same software to the t the s pen is great and the added size compared to the note 2 is even better also the display is sharp but by today's standard there's room for improvement another issue with the device i had was that it would disconnect and reconnect to wifi intermittently\n",
      "like some of you  or most  i bought this for the pen i had previously owned the other galaxy_notes the 5 and 10 inch ones but didn't really warm to them this one is better how much better remains to be seen but i suggest you try it for a week yourselves  if you are on the same bent.eventually they will get it right if this one is the real deal for me i will get back to you with a happy update but frankly i'm not very optimistic as the category is still not mature and and i'm getting a bit tired of failures but like i said this one seems better after a few days.but really for me it boils down to comfort pen and paper are very comfy but they said that about soft and hard pulp books a few years ago and of course the ebook never caught on lolupdate 1 i'm actually using this it fixes some of the issues i had with the other sizes see above the only thing that bugs me is the very slippery writing surface but its doable the built in s-pen app is fine but i just tried papyrus and this app seems way cool.anyway i will keep updating\n",
      "two years ago i bought my first tablet first generation kindle fire it's excellent for reading playing games reading email and watching netflix then i wanted a tablet that i could take handwritten notes on and the samsung galaxy_note 8.0 is perfect i've only had it a month so i'm still learning but i use it for all the things i used the kindle for plus so much more the app selection is so much larger through google play and the 8-inch size is perfect for me i did look at the ipad mini before making my choice and i'm glad i got this one instead....highly recommended\n",
      "update:i own the ipad 3 the amazon kindle fire hd 7 and this tablet unless streaming prime movies on the fire hd 7 the note 8 had become my go to tablet while my poor ipad sat ignored i did ultimately buy a kindle paperwhite 2nd gen for reading because tablet batteries run down too fast if one is a heavy reader my galaxy_note 8 is still working perfectly it's still quite a nice tablet and it's still the best perhaps only option if you desire pen functionality.despite my abysmal samsung customer service experiences i actually broke down and replaced my iphone 4 with a galaxy_note 3 and it is amazing as in best phone ever so these days i rarely use any of my tablets i use my note 3 for pretty much everything except reading ebooks love my kindle paperwhite and of course my pc is for more intensive tasks.the pen functionality in the note 3 is superior to the note 8 assuming second generation note 8 models incorporate that improved pen functionality/integration and offer a higher screen resolution they could very well be the 7-8 tablet to beat i personally recommend waiting for the next-gen note 8 if you're in the market for a penabled 8 tablet if you also need a new phone get a note 3 and see if you even feel the need for a tablet at all that said amazon tablets are wonderful especially if you are a prime subscriber and i frequently recommend them fire hd or hdx depending upon budget to friends and family i also still feel that if one doesn't care too much about the pen amazon tablets are a much better buy.original review:if you really want the penabled experience in an 8 form factor this is the only way to go  if you can get over the risk and hassle of having to deal with samsung's incompetent customer service their frequently buggy and poorly maintained web site and the premium price charged for a content consumption device with disappointing screen quality only 189 ppi).that said features aside from the pen that recommend this product include the extra screen real estate of an 8 screen over a 7 screen the ability to use samsung's split screen multi-view mode only works for certain apps the bundled apps some of the s-pen apps are quite nice i confess i rarely use them while others are simply bloatware that permanently eat your storage space unless you root the device 25 google play credit  if you can get them to fulfill it it took me months multiple attempts to register and finally contacting them four times via various methods no facebook to publicly call them to task no love 50 gb free drop box limited duration of two years micro-sd slot  although bear in mind that you won't be able to actually install most applications there unless you root your tablet i have not still nice for music/movies/photos/ebooks.if you don't feel the pen or dual-app/split screen functionality are must haves then honestly save money and consider the kindle fire hd 7 it has a better screen 216 ppi better speakers better battery life and it costs way less plus free ebook loans with prime amazon has always treated me well so i have nothing but praise for their customer service if the kindle fire hd 7 isn't pretty enough or you don't like the amazon app store and don't want to root consider the ipad mini still compromising on the screen it's even slightly worse than the note 8 at 163 ppi  shame on apple but it's also somewhat less expensive has a beautiful svelte aluminum body  and apple also has amazing customer service i can't speak to the customer service but the sorry amazon nook hd is also a nice 7 tablet actually has the best screen in the 7 form factor 243 ppi google play store access no rooting required although it's possible if you desire includes a micro-sd card slot and is going for fire sale pricing on the minus side the nook hd has a proprietary charge port  but you can stock up on spare charge cables with all the money you save.if you plan to read a lot of ebooks and don't also have or want an e-ink reader consider going for the kindle fire hd  or better yet the higher ppi nook hd you can always download the kindle app  your eyes will thank you for it\n",
      "i was contemplating for the last 3 months if i should get this or an ipad mini i finally checked them both out side to side at best buy one day and made the final decision of buying the samsung galaxy_note 8 then i had to take a day to decided if i wanted the white or brown/black one...i'm so glad i chose the samsung galaxy_note 8 i am enjoying it more than i should i mainly got it to work on working on my novels during times i'm away from home since i don't own a laptop however it's proven to be so much more fun than just a tool for working i get carried away with this even when i have my desktop computer in front of me i bought this keyboardb00c321vg0to go with it both work perfectly together.i've had my fair share of playing on other people's ipads before so i know what those are like and i'm so happy i won't have to be envious of them anymore now i think they will be envious of my new toy.things i love you can do 2 things at the same time side by side the pen makes it so much easier to draw/sketch and make notes typing on that flat screen is easy with the pen if you can only use one hand easy access to settings you can personalize so many things like having widgets and apps and changing font type size notification noises etc.(i think all ipads look the same but when you look at the front page of these tablets you'll know right away if it's yours or not having the microsd card slot for more memory up to 64gb more i believe the extra buttons i love the back arrow button not just one home button like ipads have)disappointments just one the camera isn't really great but hey it's a tablet not a dslr so i'm not supposed to expect much connecting to the computer is a pain and confusing i haven't really gotten into it because i hesitate dealing with the annoyance\n",
      "it's absolutely a great product it will set the example for future technology to come.the productivity on this is incredible i use it for note taking the cameras just suck pretty soon there will be tablets just like this with s-pens hd screen resolution 8 megapixel and 3 megapixel cameras and probably some 3d features the screen resolution on this is absolutely great and handwriting is very natural though ignore the complaints.trying it first at best buy is what i recommend i decided to buy from best buy  no play store credit was included as promotion from amazon might suggest but i still got the dropbox credit and around 5 dollar in store credit with new bb card).i highly recommend the moko slim cover case for samsung galaxy_note 8.0 inch gt  n5100 android tablet black with lip stand integrated elastic hand strap and stylus loop(payed 5.99 and it's definitely a 5 star product!)hope i helped \n",
      "the more i use it the more i like it i've only had it a few days and still playing with all of its features but i really like it the s pen is very practical and convenient i like to write/take notes and i'm an amateur artist today i created my first drawing using the s pen and it turned out pretty good i'm sure that as i keep exploring the different functions and get more familiarized with the device i will become more attached to it the only downside is that i'm unable to watch amazon movies with this device but not a big deal to me as there are other apps that allow me to watch free movies on the tablet as i understand it the issue is with amazon and not this device i am very glad that i decided to purchase the galaxy_note 8 and not the tab version\n",
      "i was the first in line in my local store and got one the weight is ideal it feels very nice to hold and work on it it is definitely expensive than its counterparts but having a well integrated stylus makes it an excellent buy i was able to run many apps/games/navigation/music/youtube videos fast and smooth i have verified using a 32 gb sd card and basically carry all of your music the total storage is effectively 48 gb i have a 50 g box and other cloud accounts so i don't store movies/songs on this also google music works great on this i have close to 10,000 songs on google music the playback and speaker quality is ok i expected a better speaker for its size 1.6ghz quad-core processor and 2gb of ram makes applications butter smooth i for someone like the plastic finish and i think this is great for what it does lightweight no scratch and looks awesome on this device lot of press criticizes samsung for its plastic but who cares customers seems to love this design i also confirmed this note 8.0 takes 64 gb microsd card.i use google keep for note taking on galaxy_note 8.0 and it is awesome i like everything on google ecosystem as it is seamless keep is in early stages and i am sure google will update to keep it modern note taking is one of the string points of this tablet and there are several apps out there keep onenote samsung's own apps and lot of third party apps keep debuted only in 2013 and is simple and powerful!pen is awesome and it is almost like holding a traditional notepad for notetaking kids will love hundreds of sketching apps this has s-gps as opposed to a-gps but gets gps locks easily my navigon is great for in car navigation now to get a mount obviously i need to mount lower and not at dashboard level big maps nice navigation google navigation will not work without a mifi or some sort of mobile connectivity you can usefreedom spot photon 4g mobile hotspot black)which i am using while on car freedompop uses clearwire technology and has great coverage where i live you get 500 gb free each month!some complaints i am highly disappointed samsung dropped 4g and mobile connectivity in the us having a phone functionality is a big plus even though it is weird to hold against your head speakerphone/bluetooth are excellent options i really dislike carrying multiple devices watchon is basically useless for me as i have an older tv samsung is trying to get you into their ecosystem expensive its competitor google nexus 7 tablet 16 gb or evensamsung galaxy_tab 2 7-inch wi-fi)are far cheaper if you are not into latest you can take a step back my recommendation will be for asus fonepad which is a 7 and has a phone functionality built in it may sound weird but integrated devices are all the rage would have preferred a better camera.i am giving a 4 star mainly because of the price if it is 300 would get a 5 stars i am sure price will drop steeply once demand increases i will upgrade to 5 stars once price drops!some of the apps i have tried on this tablet so far are  amazon kindle alogcat asphalt 7 battery monitor widget pro shows accurate measurements car reminder maintenance pro chrome dragonvale draw something google drive ebay facebook flashlight very handy flipboard keep though samsung note app is great samsung apps lastpass merriam webster dictionary navigon google nav using mifi pac-man  pogoplug gives me terabytes on the go on wifi from my home private cloud realcalc great calculator program nike running great visualization subsonic skype switchpro widget taptalk hd awesome app tweetcaster pro twit.tv withings weight watcher app youtube terminal emulator.ask me questions and i will answer within a day or if you want me to try some apps on this tablet i like answering questions/comments here from users\n",
      "i took the plunge on a refurbished note 8 and couldn't be happier i have owned many pen devices over the years from the original compaq ipaq ibm wacom based thinkpads and the original galaxy_note phone i'm going to start this review by saying don't buy this tablet if you don't want a pen based device there are cheaper options that will fill the tablet role without the added cost of the wacom pen if you are still reading i'll assume you want a device with a real pen.the note 8 is the perfect size for a note taking device the galaxy_note i phone i own and love just wasn't big enough to make the pen really useful for me the design of the tablet is simple with gently curved corners and a fairly wide bezel the lack of an easily removable back provides decent rigidity that makes it feel less creaky than my phone the back can be removed for a fairly easy battery replacement but it is not meant to be swapped in and out like a phone battery i wish samsung didn't put the big chrome logo on top but it is what it is.the pen is slightly longer and fatter than the pen that comes with the note phones it is mostly round with a flat side where the button is the tip of the pen has a nice texture which adds some drag when used on the glass the nib is not replaceable with standard wacom nibs i personally use a wacom pen that i purchased for my laptop it has the eraser on one end and replaceable nibs it is the size of a standard pen and obviously won't fit in the tablets pen holder i find it much nicer to write with than the provided pen.from an inking perspective the pen is accurate for me i'm left handed and i don't have any issues with the alignment of the nib and on-screen cursor position there is some minor lag if you are drawing fast where you may notice the ink takes a fraction of a second to catch up it's not horrible but may be noticeable and annoying if you are expecting the device to be just like ink and paper in truth it's pretty fast compared to other wacom devices i've used i always put a screen protector on my pen devices while the glass is durable all it takes is a small grain to get caught on your tip or eraser to make a scratch i am using theismooth samsung galaxy_note 8 ultra clear premium hd screen protector 2 packwhich is working out well.if you are looking for a case check out themoko slim cover case for samsung galaxy_note 8.0 inch gt  n5100 android tablet black with lip stand integrated elastic hand strap and stylus loop)-lifetime warranty it fits well and the brown leather looks nice in contrast to the white tablet there is some talk about the magnets in many of the cases interfering with the s-pen possibly even causing permanent problems so i took an exacto knife and carefully removed them from the case.on the application side s-note is where the note 8 makes the s-pen shine it does everything you would expect a note taking app to do including the ability to export notes to a pdf for sharing with non s-note users the only thing missing for me feature in microsoft one note where it translates your ink in the background and makes your handwritten notes searchable.from a general perspective of tablet use the note 8 works fine the lcd is sharp and has great viewing angles video playback is smooth and the device feels very snappy in general i appreciate that samsung still provides a micro sd slot it is becoming too rare these days as is normal for samsung they add in their usual bloatware apps that can't be removed while you can root the galaxy_note 8 if you install an android rom like cyanogenmod you will loose the ability to run s-note and many of the other tightly integrated s-pen features samsung tends to be stingy with their os updates and i'll be surprised if they support the device after 4.4 kitkat the battery is good but not stellar be careful with apps that provide background notifications/updates as they will chew away at your battery when the tablet is idle.in summary the note 8 is almost perfect for me if microsoft released a fully functional version of one note for android i would be in heaven but it will never happen the surface pro is just too big and expensive for what i need at the current price the refurbished note 8 is about the same price as a good new 7 tablet without a pen which seems like a great deal to me\n",
      "have had the samsung galaxy_note 8.0 for about a month now and i love it it is my go to tablet i have an older ipad 2nd gen that is still up to date but this samsung has a lot of advantages over the full sized ipad first the samsung note 8.0 has an sd slot and i can add additional storage space for a very small cost second the size this tablet is the size of the ipad mini i have a full size ipad the note 8.0 is much lighter smaller and it fits in my purse i can access my work e-mail via the touchdown app not a huge fan of the app but it is what my employer requires and it functions i can easily connect the tablet to a wireless keyboard and it is easier to read a book on the samsung note 8.0 than on a full sized ipad.a second important comparison my husband bought a verizon samsung galaxy_tab 2 for me as a gift it was 100 more than the regular tab 2 because it was compatable with verizon and this note 8.0 cost 100 more than the verizon tab 2 and it is not 4g lte within 11 days i maxed out the tab 2 the tab 2 has 1gb of ram and this was not enough to support all of the things that i wanted my tablet to be able to do the guy at best buyin the samsung department told me that sure i could switch and use my iphone 5 to access the internet as a hot spot when i was not near wifi but that it would not be very fast or as smooth as the tab 2 i paid the additional 100 and upgraded to the note 8.0 any way this was the best decision this tablet is so much faster than the tab 2 i am so happy that i made the switch!!!in the end there are some things that i prefer to do on the ipad and based on the technology there are some things that just work better on the apple ios than on android but if had to pick between the ipad or ipad mini and the galaxy_note 8.0 i would pick the note 8.0 hands down.i hope this helps you and if you have any questions i will do my best to answer.9/29/13  the other day i tried to watch an amazon instant video only to find that flash would not work and even though an amazon video android app exists it will not work on this or other samsung devices i was going to drop this by one star but this appears to be an amazon decision not a samsung decision it appears that the only android device that will work is the kindle fire unfortunately amazon will let this app work on apple devices just not other androids this is frustrating but ultimately i decided this was an amazon issue and not an issue with the device i do wish it would run flash but apparently the only tablet that can run flash is the new windows tablet hope this is helpful\n",
      "i bought this to replace my original ipad ipad 1  before they numbered them i travel a great deal and wanted something that like the ipad:1 has a good battery life ipad 10  galaxy_note 6)2 worked with all my office documents ipad 5  galaxy_note with one note  kingsoft office 8)3 was easy to access and use when crunched for time in an airport ipad  galaxy_note 10)i am very pleased with the galaxy_note 8 the features i like best are:1 android os  more free apps and overall cost of apps is less more flexibility in customizing similar os as my moto razr maxx2 very fast processor3 great memory i have a large number of apps and it never gets bogged down due to too many things running4 i've added a keyboard and case that helps with productivity5 quality and brightness of the screen exceptional although not oled i am very pleased with the screen6 the touch and feel of the screen are perfect.7 i don't use the s pen as much as i thought i would but is very nice to have when i choose to use it.the size of the galaxy_note 8 is the most difficult thing for me to get used to not the screen size per se but the size and feel of the note itself it is just too big for me to comfortably hold in one hand but still smaller than the full size ipad i used before by this i am not complaining about the screen size i think the screen size is very good rather it is just a bit awkward feeling but i am getting more used to it\n",
      "i would give the galaxy_note 8 five stars except that i had hardware issues with the screen the note is fast and has a vivid screen i got the wifi version only and upgrading it was very easy several goodies came with the samsung note registration like 25 to use at the play store and 50 to use at samsung watchon if i had known this i would not have agonized nearly as much about spending the money for this tablet.the only downside was that the screen started to fail after a week and showed colored blocks i thought the upgrade or some app was the culprit samsung support was good and after trying a few things i ended up resetting the note back to factory settings this seemed to work for a few days and then the issues started again i worked with samsung support and saw that pressing the screen was now making it change colors now i knew this was a hardware issue support sent me a link to print the label and shipping was free it took less than a week to get the note fixed and returned fortunately i live close to a service center the note has worked great since one other downside was that i added a 64gb micro sd card and forgot to remove it before sending it in the card was not supposed to be touched but it was removed and not returned i called samsung and they promised to send an amex gift certificate that will basically cover the cost of the sd card the amex gift cheque arrived today\n",
      "i purchased one of the brown/black tablets shortly after the release of the new nexus 7 after looking for a tablet that would be useful for taking notes during meetings at work as well as providing me with a fun functional tablet.operating system:the stock operating system of the note 8.0 is android and while it is very snappy it is slightly behind compared to the new nexus 7 which came with 4.3 the note 8.0 has some trick functionality built into the samsung touchwiz interface where it automatically loads a list of s-note templates when the s pen is removed from its silo housed on the bottom right of the tablet personally i have used touchwiz before on my galaxy_s3 but i didn't like the feel i have upgraded to a different launcher that allows for more customization to all screens android is highly adaptable and highly customizable which is one of my number one reasons for choosing this tablet vs an ipad mini or the new nexus 7.feel:the body of the tablet is made of the same plastic and glass as the rest of the samsung galaxy flagship line on a tablet of this size it doesn't feel bad the corners are nicely sculpted the screen is slick and smooth the s pen is tucked neatly away inside the lower right corner of the tablet and comes out with a satisfying click when removed it is nearly a bit too large to handle with one hand but is large enough that typing is easy even for someone with large fingers.screen:the resolution of the screen is 1280x800 and at 189ppi it is quite a bit higher than the current generation ipad mini 163ppi but significantly lower than the newest nexus 7 323ppi there are some applications that look a bit rough but the majority of those applications are optimized for phones rather than tablets while the nexus 7 kills this tablet on resolution alone it doesn't have an s-pen or any of the s-pen specific apps avaiable so these are really two different animals.speed:the speed and memory of this tablet are right on par with the rest of the tablets available in the coming months it is fast handles multiple processes with ease i have noticed no slow down issues when watching video and using other apps at the same time.battery life:i have been getting several days out of the battery at a shot depends on my daily usage however i have wifi set to sleep when the display is off unless it is plugged into an outlet and charging usually i am seeing between 6-7hrs of screen on time before getting to about 10 battery i leave display brightness set to auto and smart stay is on.s-pen:the s-pen that is included with the device is much larger than those that come with the note and note 2 phones it feels very good in your hand and is definitely usable by people with larger hands me being one of them i still however have chosen to purchase a larger s-pen for comfort reasons when trying to sketch or take notes quickly.i am very happy with the galaxy_note 8.0 overall i would have rated it higher if there were more tablet optimized android apps available a slightly higher screen resolution and if the price were lower at this time the note 8.0 is really the only android tablet of this size to offer the s-pen and samsung knows that so they charge for it the experience of using the s-pen is in an entirely different world than using a capacitive stylus on any other device\n",
      "i bought this for my verizon galaxy_note 3 it works and displays my screen on my tv it comes with a micro usb port to plug in a standard micro usb cable to either provide the power needed to display the image on the tv if not using an mhl hdmi port or if you are using an mhl port it will 34;charge your phone&#34 in my experience it will more or less extend the life of your battery while using this device it drains but very very slowly while plugged in i watched a 2 hour movie from my phone on the tv and it was 100 charged when i started and at 89 battery charge when i was done and that was using an mhl port and the micro usb cable to charge the phone so the power it uses is slightly more than it can receive during operation.my other complaint is how touchy it is if you bump it even in the slightest it will interrupt the picture sometimes i even have to unplug it and plug it back in to get it going again so it's great for long movies where the phone will be untouched but not so good for games since you are moving the phone and the cable likely won't perform at least with my experience.for how often i use it not that often it still does what i want and was a good buy just know what you are getting\n",
      "horrible product not original samsung device never worked with my galaxy_note 3 as advertised stay away from this product\n",
      "product came in a small box packaged with an rf choke to filter any em noise coming from the phone connection it is important to follow the setup procedure in order for it to function properly have played videos music and screen mirrored apps all very clearly through the hdmi connection using a galaxy_note 10.1 2014 edition\n",
      "the magnets can interfere with accuracy and operation of the active stylus screen.the stand functionality does not work at all the magnets presumably in response to complaints about digitizer interference have been made so weak that they cannot bear the weight of the tablet let alone actually using it.very little impact or shock protection with hard plastic back and thin cover the book cover isn't very durable and shows wear along the edges within a few weeks of use.the original list price of 49.99 was ridiculous for a case of this type even at discount it's not worth 39 or even half that the one single plus of this case is that it looks good is quite light and maintains the svelte dimensions of the galaxy_note 8.0\n",

      "my friend has a galaxy_note and i was envious of his large screen so i upgraded my tiny iphone 4s to the samsung un85s9 85-inch 4k ultra hd it was worth it to see my friend's face when i pulled this baby out of my oversized jacket pocket the image is gorgeous it has a sturdy stand but the battery life is non-existent the reception is poor although i hardly ever make calls and--i must admit--it is a bit heavy for a phone i plan to get another one for my wife\n",
      "one of the best tablets out there might even be considered a flagship android device if it weren't for the galaxy_note tablet\n",
      "the samsung galaxy_tab3 10.1 is the first tablet i ever bought and i love it the pictures and videos are clear it responds quickly and it is light and easy to handle it took me a few weeks to get used to using it as some things are different from computers but now i am very glad i bought it being able to use a micro sd card and a regular usb flash drive with the help of an adapter--that you have to buy separately--with a tiny plug on one end for the port on the tablet and a regular-size usb plug-in for the port in your computer i can carry around any number of books and other things i want to see on the tablet tablet-savvy people here probably know this already but there is also an inexpensive device sabrent's multi-card reader that you can plug into a usb port on your computer in order to read any of several sizes of micro cards which is nice if you have made videos with the tablet and want an easy way to get them into your computer you can also use drop box to do that but transferring videos through drop box takes a long time.i am sure that as i go on using this tablet i will discover more interesting things to do with it but at this point i am so happy with my purchase that when my husband more or less took over the 10.1 tablet i went out and bought myself a samsung galaxy_note 8 which i also like very very much\n",
      "there are some amazingly helpful reviews that i am not going to repeat my reasons for purchasing this tablet over others is it's perfect for me as both a musician and a samsung galaxy_smartphone owner.my primary reason for choosing this over other brands is because i own a galaxy_note 3 phone and the interfaces are identical i did try out some other brands all of where were nice and some better than this one specifically thelenovo yoga multimode 10-inch tablet but i wanted something familiar my reason for choosing this over another samsung model  thesamsung galaxy_tab 3 8-inch which was actually faster had better screen resolution and the ability to split the screen is the extra 2.1 inches on this one it made a difference when it came to reading the screen i am 65 and my eyes are not what they once were.i will admit that i was a little disappointed in the memory my galaxy_note 3 phone has 32gb of internal memory whereas this tablet only has 16gb that disappointment is offset  to a degree  by the fact that this will accept a 64gb sd card like my phone i am using a fairly inexpensive compared to the samsung brand card that works perfectly:sandisk ultra 64 gb microsdxc class 10 uhs-1 memory card.since i am not using any apps that will tax the relatively weak processor compared to many other tablets from both samsung and competitors i can live with that aspect if i were looking for power i would have gone with the tab 3 8 inch my main app on this is a relatively simple one calledireal pro music book  play along.another selling point for me is the battery life the 6800 mah capacity allows me to go an easy six hours between charges no gig is that long so it's perfect the specs claim eight hours but i have never gotten more than seven i am not wild about the fact that the battery is sealed like the ipad but it was one of the compromises i knowingly made when i purchased it.one other thing that took some getting accustomed to is the fact that the buttons and controls are set up for landscape use this makes perfect sense but coming from a phone to a tablet the orientation does have a learning curve.for musicians here is a tip you can mount this on some music stands using analeratec universal tablet car headrest mount holder see my review of that product for details.bottom line this is not the best tablet for power users nor does it have the best display however for uses like those i am employing it for this is a good enough tablet with some excellent features at a decent price point\n",
      "great product fast sync with my available samsung smart phones like s4 and galaxy_note 1 my sister likes it very much the fact that it is a refurbished so it is cheaper worth every penny\n",
      "i'll update this review later as i do with most electronics because the true test of it spans a few months.first impressions after having it for a week this is a great tablet it may not be top of the line but it works very well for what i need my last tablet was an asus transformer prime which i bought two and half years ago even today the prime had specs to rival the majority of top tier tablets quad core processor plenty of ram and memory an incredible screen but it was so damn unstable it would lag freeze wifi was weak due to the aluminum backing internet browsing was a chore and eventually the keyboard became so frustrating and unusable the camera wiring was shoddy and stopped working a year ago and the screen finally gave out when i dropped it while it was in a case in my bag from a height of two feet or so i decided i was done with asus tablets and electronics in general from the less reputable companies.this galaxy_tab 3 so far has been a dream to use it's not really faster and the screen is actually a lower resolution so it's a little less crisp but i didn't need something much more powerful and i don't care if app icons look 34;a little fuzzy&#34 as some people complain about i just needed something from a reliable manufacturer that was stable and fluid and so far i've gotten exactly that still a 10&#34 screen thats very bright with excellent picture and movie quality a little smaller much lighter switching apps is smooth it doesn't lag as much the wifi signal capability is stronger than my droid razr and the samsung ui feels much more polished.overall i'm thoroughly enjoying this tablet i considered the galaxy_note 10.1 because it has more memory 1.5-2gb i believe depending on the model as opposed to 1gb the tab 3 but it still runs very fast i use it for browsing games and all my class textbooks pdfs and streamed lectures it runs everything very well i guess if you have use for the stylus or need the ability to run dual apps side by side maybe doing a lot of spreadsheets note taking and business that requires complete fluidity maybe go for the note so you'll never be starved for extra memory to run fast but the tab 3 is an excellent tablet for the value and i got it for about half the price i paid for my prime when it was initially released\n",
      "i chose this one after seeing it at office max..and of course the price with amazon was far lower than a retail office supply  easy to learn as my cell phone is the galaxy_note 2  upgrade later..of course \n",
      "i just received gt 3 10.1 today i have been using gt 10.1 for two years i bought it on june 2011 and i liked the rounded edge and hair-lined back feels good and the bright and colourful screen that is why i bought gt 3 10.1 again meanwhile i had bought nexus 10 and xperia tablet z but sold them all soon because nexus 10 had washed-out colour and z had yellowish screen of course they are not the only reasons).now i knew gt 3 10.1 had the same resolution of screen all i wanted was just the same screen as that of my 2-year old gt 10.1 but alas who would have guessed it the screen totally sucks first of all it is yellowish i guess it is not as yellowish as that of z but still why the hell a new model's screen is worse than two-year old model not only the screen is yellowish but somehow the text looks blurry i think it is not because of the resolution because my gt 10.1 had the same resolution on gt 3 10.1 text look like text on a crt monitor i cannot explain it with words...and haptic vibration motor is gone vibration was one of the few reasons i chose samsung tablets because nexus 7 and z did not have it gt 10.1 had haptic motor and why is it gone in gt 3 10.1 i know it is 100 cheap but come on i did not intentionally buy 100 cheaper model but because samsung did not sell high-end 10.1 tablet model galaxy_note 10.1 is too heavy and already 1-year old).as i saw on youtube the two capacitive buttons are way too large i mean if the x in the next figure is the actual button location touching anywhere on the underlined area registers as touch x it may be ok if you use it laying down but if you hold it one had and the other is for touching the screen the middle is where you hold the tablet and there are overly sensitive touch buttons this is ridiculous i think only the actual button position should work not the extra area around the button.i thought i was going to use it as a remote controller for my fan but the bundled app only supported tvs and media players it did not have any custom device mode that allows me to register a button by recording from a remote controller z's bundles software allowed it i searched play store but surprisingly there was any such app all i found were tv controllers and some stupid apps that did not even support horizontal orientation i also saw some ridiculously overpriced apps like 50 for ir control but i did not buy it i think i am going to write my own software for that and upload it to google play i had registered as a developer).the edge is not rounded as much as gt 10.1 it is still better than the stupid edged z but still worse than gt 10.1 gt 10.1 feels much better when holding it in hands.camera sucks it does not even have autofocus which gt 10.1 had that is it is even down-spec'ed from a two-year old predecessor of course flash is also gone all these for 100 damn it samsung i would have happily paid 100 more if you made gt 3 10.1 a premium device not a cheap model like it is.now let's see the bright sides...1 speakers are a bit louder than that of gt 10.1 louder but not noticeably better.2 physical home button makes it easy to turn on the tablet when it is laying down.3 microsd card works fine gt 10.1 did not have microsd.4 it is not as super fast but definitely faster than gt 10.1 gt 10.1 is too slow now this new model also plays 1080p fine i tried many files and all files played fine gt 10.1 could only play 720p files except some 1080p wmv files i knew that it did not have fast cpu but i think the performance is ok for general use so far so good.5 no special charger is needed just using the charger for galaxy_nexus worked.i will update for more information after using it for a few more days.====update  24th november 2013=====initially i was trying to sell it but failed so i have used it for about 5 months so far maybe it is something like a stockholm syndrome but i do not hate it now as much as i hated it first.my gt 10.1 started show weird strains on the screen so for the last few months i did not use it but used gt 3 10.1 i use it almost everyday to watch videos and youtube i do have an ipad 3 but it is too heavy and difficult to transfer files to maybe my eyes have been adjusted to the screen of gt 3 10.1 now it does not look as yellowish as it seemed before it is generally ok and wow now the price is dropped by 100 at that point i cannot complain much.the points i appreciate about gt 3 10.1 after using it for 5 months:0 it is light not lighter than the new ipad air but it is still one of the lightest 10.1-inch tablet i carry it when i go out and it does not hurt my shoulder noticeably.1 ok performance not super fast and there are some delays when switching between apps but it performs quite fast and fluid maybe not good for demanding 3d games though.2 microsd card with ntfs support.3 build quality well i cannot say gt 3 10.1 is perfect but there are not many alternatives at this price point all unbranded chinese 10-inch tablets  i avoid it because it gets no software supports from anywhere they usually have really bad displays lousy build qualities nexus 10  too heavy with no expansion slot ipad  um i need an android tablet kindle fire  too small i want 10 tablet z transformer something  pricier than gt 3 10.1 have yellowish screens etc note 10.1 2014 edition  i tested it and it was sluggish my gt 3 10.1's screen was brighter than that of note 10.1 2014 edition i compared it with my own eyes).but here are my complaints about gt 3 10.1 after using it for 5 months:0 the back/menu buttons sensitivity still bothers me i really wish all three buttons were mechanical buttons or they were on the right margin of the device with some extra margin to grip on like b&n;'s nook hd+.1 notification menu seems stupid it does not utilise the large screen gt 3 10.1 has wide width but narrow height so if i were the engineers i would have made the items into two columns the items appear too wide and since it has narrow height i often have to scroll down to see other items.2 lack of a notification led i really wonder why they did not put this my gs 3 has it and it is very helpful to see if it is charging any new messages how much does it cost anyway to put a small led lamp?3 the back is too slippery gt 10.1 has hairlines and not slippery at all how much does it cost to put hairlines on the back seriously?4 google now since its home button is a physical button i cannot use swipe it up to start google now i wish i could map home button double click to google now but i cannot frankly speaking samsung s-voice sucks\n",
      "i was looking for a smaller tablet to carry around in my pack for the daily commute i was hoping to read some ebooks play a couple of games and listen to a song or two i picked this tablet up on sale at a local big box store i wish now i had spent a little more for something a bit beefier this tablet is slooooooow slow to load slow to navigate just plain slow i purposely didn't overload this thing with software so there wouldn't be much running behind the scenes i have a 32gig card with a lot of ebooks on it and no matter which software i use the thing stalls trying to index the books i pop the same card into my galaxy_note 10.1 and it reads it like a charm the card is also readable on my computer so i know it isn't a case of a bad card i suppose i could use a smaller card put fewer books on the one i have etc but that seems like more trouble than it is worth the games i've tried to play angry birds wwf are also slow i've tried to watch a netflix movie on it and it too seems to hesitate in spots again the same movie same network does not display the hesitation on other systems as i said wishing i had passed on this one\n",
      "this tablet isn't really the greatest it could be worse but it could also be better buy i guess you get what you pay for my only complaint is the speed it's pretty slow most of the time it takes a while to load web pages and it always buffers when i'm watching videos whether it's youtube netflix or whatever i'm trying to watch another thing is the smart remote when i try to use it it glitches whenever i pull the tab to show the controls nothing is there it's just a little tab in the middle of the screen i would recommend saving your money and getting the galaxy_note nexus 7 or ipad mini\n",
      "i recently won this and gave it to my husband i don't think it is a product that i would have thought to purchase because when we previously looked at it the reviews were not all that great in fact my husband purchased the tab 2 for me instead of this one because the tab 2 had better reviews i returned the tab 2 after less than 15 days for a note 8 but that is not the point of this review so i will not go into it further for this review this tablet has been a very pleasant surprise!my husband has not had any problems with this tablet it is peppy/fast and seems to offer everything that he needs we added a 32gb card to it so it now has 40gb of memory 17 investment he had been using our old ipad 2nd gen and he is not a tech geek like me but he seems to really like this device and the size of this device he has not picked up the ipad since he got this i tried to set it all up for him before giving it to him and found later that he was enjoying customizing the device himself which made me happy!we own a lot of tablets and this one fits in with the others quite well in my opinion it is a much better value than the ipad or ipad mini largely because the operating systems are so similar at this point the apps are similar and you can add memory to this device which is something you cannot do on any ipad oh and i have found a number of android apps that allow you to sync to itunes for your music and movies and then other apps that allow you to sync to your icloud calendar contact and to do list.in terms of this versus the other less expensive android tablets that we own the main differences would be how the company samsung in this case sets up the android environment and the fact that this device has a button instead of all touch screen buttons overall this is a nice tablet for the price point if i could change one thing i would have it be 16 gb instead of 8 the 8gb is fine for my husband who does not have a ton of large apps that run better on the device vs the card but my kids have a lot of kid friendly high graphic large memory apps that run better on the device vs the memory card i think this device would not have been a great choice for my kids.please note  android devices generally with the exception of the kindle which does not have a memory slot cannot play amazon video i believe this is amazon's choice and not the choice of the manufacturers.here are the similar devices that we own:1 samsung galaxy_note 82 lenovo a30003 dell venue 7 16gb4 ipad 2if you have any questions about the different devices i am happy to answer any questions you might have\n",
      "i recently purchased a samsung smart tv they gave me 170 off for a samsung galaxy_tab 3 8.0  so my net cost was 130 i also own a samsung galaxy_note 2 love their products the size of this tablet is awesome i wish they will upgrade to android 4.3 or 4.4 soon highly recommend this perfect size tablet it's very fast and fluid\n",
      "updated review  july 3 2014 one year of ownership so i have found that this tablet continues to exceed all of my expectations and more today it updated ota to kit kat 4.2.2 kernel version date june 17 2014 now this tablet is up to date it may take a few weeks for you to receive this as samsung just started rolling out the kit kat update very recently so if you are looking a high quality eight inch tablet this may very well be the once for you for me i found that this tablet has that wow factor so below i am listing the many pros i personally have found while using this tablet:pros overall speed and performance and android os:with the fast 1.5 ghz processor i have found this to be a very fast tablet and for me all has been running so smoothly on this tablet love that this tablet has 16gb internal memory.the android os as of july 3 2014 has 4.2.2 kit kat and inside it has samsung touchwiz overlay which is beautiful and user friendly in fact if you have used a samsung galaxy device as s2 s3 s4 or other galaxy type you will love the os and the samsung touch wiz interface on this perhaps you have never used android os or even a samsung device no worries as this tablet is easy to learn in my opinion about the new kit kat update coming soon to tab 3 8.0 tablets some of you may be want this update automatically some of you may not so if you have not decided about upgrading then you are going to need to stop the tablet or phone from auto upgrading for you it will try to auto update to the new os as soon as it rolls out from the factory your provider etc that is unless you decide to stop this and do the upgrade when you are ready manually ask me more about this in the comments if you need to do so screen size is just right size  very clear/sharp screen for reading ebooks or viewing webpages screen in my opinion is large and has superb clarity/clearness for reading ebooks and webpages as the print is so readable as i find it very clear/vivid this is a great in-between size tablet to use and i found that the screen was large enough to read webpages easily or watch videos the screen has a ppi pixels per inch of 189 which renders a crisp and clear screen there is a new selection under settings and display under font an option to increase legibility of fonts i check marked this and noticed that the fonts/letters on the screen internet and more are very crystal clear also there is in settings/display  screen mode with choices of dynamic standard and movie and i selected dynamic and found that the colors are super vivid and very colorful external slot for micro sd card  it is said that you can add a 64gb sd card for personal files in my case i have a 32gb sd card and still have plenty of room after my songs files and photos are added a 64 gb card has different formatting and i have not used this size just the 32gb about sd cards keep in mind where external sd cards are concerned they are just for your personal files music videos photos and other files when you install apps from the playstore or other sources they store either in internal sd card area or the main internal area this is the law of the land where android is concerned and all newer android devices including samsung work this way where storing your downloaded apps are concerned wifi connecting/speed of wifi  setting up wifi and keeping a great signal and long distance wifi strong signal is one superb feature on this tablet so i compared the signal strength with the tab 3 vs my regular android phone the tab 3 had about 35 stronger signal then the phone i believe it is because there is a very strong wifi receiver in this tablet at home or on the road i am able to connect to many free wifi hotspots very easily with great signal strength.****do you need to know how to get on the internet when you are out of a wifi range ask me about this as i have written an article on how to do this using a mifi type of service from different service providers please ask in the comment section for more info internet/watching online flash videos after i installed adobe archived flash i can watch internet flash videos directly.because this is archived flash it does take a little longer to load flash videos if you need instructions on how to do this please ask in the comments and i will answer this or any questions.*viewing of webpages in browsers on this tablet reading/viewing a webpage is outstanding using this tablet as the fonts pictures and videos are very crisp and clear as well as the colors are very vivid reading/creating/editing word excel text files and much more on this tablet this comes with a ok app for reading office documents however i prefer kingsoft office which is a free app from playstore it is the best i have ever tried and i am very picky about so called office programs it is very compatible with ms office as it reads edits and creates office files and reads pdf files and it has more features of any other android office program that i tried this app is a must have for tablet owners in my opinion home videos  the stock video player is ok and plays most home videos however may i suggest qq player this is a free app from playstore and it plays every home video i tried also mx video player is very good however i prefer qq player music player/sound quality  stock player has clear sound through the outside speakers are really ok better with good quality headphones or a bluetooth speaker to sync easily with windows media player may i suggest the playstore app free called winamp for the tablet as it is very highly rated and the sound is superb battery life excellent so far however this is what i have found when i am on wifi i go to the websites i need and then as soon as i am done reasonable time i exit the browser or youtube etc and turn off wifi however i run my brightness at 100 so this seems to keep the battery going longer in addition i have found that my battery life is improved over the tab 2 7.0 and the tab 2 10.1 kindle app  i installed the kindle app and synced my kindle books began to read a new book and was very impressed with how exceptional the book rendered using this tab 3 8.0 very impressed as the text was very crisp and clear camera  the 5mp rear camera on this tab 3 8.0 has improved over the tab 2 line there is no flash on the camera yet there are several helpful modes to enhance your shots for me i use auto mode and i tried the camera and video and was happily surprised in the quality  it is pretty good however i will continue to use my regular camera for serious picture taking and videos otg usb compatible  you can add an optional otg on the go micro usb adapter cable to the micro port for copying files to your flash drive and from your flash drive to the tab 3 i already had one from my note i and it works great on the tab you can also plug in a mouse i tried it and it worked note that portable external hard drives and portable dvd/cd drives will not work using otg in the tab 3 as i discovered when i tried to read my hard disks via otg in the tab 3 however it is still good to know that you can easily plug in your flash drive and copy files to the tab 3 and from tab 3 to pc--what a time-saver bluetooth speed and performance  the bluetooth paired quickly with several devices as well as bluetooth keyboards bluetooth stereo headsets bluetooth speakers all i tried and copied files at a great rate of speed superb and fast bluetooth screenshots there is no icon for screenshots however to take a quick screenshot hold down home button and power button at the same time and then it will take a beautiful screenshot you can find your screenshot in myfiles internal storage pictures and screenshots i use this sometimes for a map on the internet it saves time and this way it is saved for later viewing when i am offline micro usb port  no more having to use the old type of non standard usb charger/cable that the tab 2 line had however this tablet requires a 2 amp usb charger to charge the tablet so it will not charge on a standard 1 amp phone charger as i tried and only the 2 amp one will work this tablet uses the same micro 2 amp type of chargers that the galaxy_note 8 uses.con just one however not the fault of samsung just one con/concern new adobe flash is not supported however i found that archived flash gets the online videos to play and they even play in the stock browser so i downloaded the older archived flash which gives me the ability to view many internet videos if you need instructions just ask me in the comments and i will answer bottom line/my suggestions to you would i buy this wifi only model over again yes because this tab 3 8.0 is lightweight easy to hold in one hand and it just as easy to hold as the tab 3 7 inch yet has so much more screen real-estate than the tab 3 7 inch and clarity etc for just 90 dollars more this is a much better buy and i have found because the screen is so crisp and clear it reads internet pages clearer videos are larger and much clearer to see etc and the 8 inch is so easy to pop into a briefcase bag or purse etc than say a large 10 inch is...if you travel and want to go light may i suggest this tab 3 8.0 to you!also since i am somewhat of a techie person i will be glad to answer any questions that you may have just ask in the comment section and i will answer promptly\n",
      "in my humble opinion...this device is a little deceiving it is extremely slim and well designed but it is also heavy in the hand perhaps this is a mindglitch as one might expect its small thin appearance to lead to it having an almost weightless feather like feel and it doesn't right out of the box i though wow this is a bit heavy for the size and form).having said that the weight and sometimes sluggish performance are the only flaws with this tablet i have samsung gs 4 and i had a samsung galaxy_note tablet 10.1 it was stolen hence my need for a new tablet and i must say that especially because the gs 4 is so lightening fast playing with both devices at the same time makes it obvious which device just has more power for its performance i was torn between the samsung galaxy_tab pro 8.4 and chose this one because of the price but i will say if speed and power are things you just cannot compromise on pay the extra 100usd and get the new 8.4 pro.it does what i need it to do and it is so stunning light and 8 really is a perfect size i love that it feels like a larger version of my samsung galaxy_s4 so there is no learning curve or shock when i move from device to device i love samsung for this reason they have mastered brand loyalty by extension of their products seamlessly working together.i have a great screen protector by 34;amfilm&#34 that is an anti-glare fingerprint protector so it really makes it not only great for reading but the touch no need to clean every 5 minutes the case is a moko slim case for the tab in indigo which i was worried would look too purply but it is such a deep blue that is just looks like it must have cost a fortune soft to the touch and very well designed i feel like all in all i have an amazing tablet and i will take it out with me more than i did my galaxy_note 10.1 because i did feel like it was just a bit too big and perhaps just not as portable as an 8inch screen is.great tablet at a now great price!only wish it were a tad lighter\n",
      "i had a galaxy_note and i was tired of it phone was slow and freezed too much and finally got rid of it and i was thinking this tabled would do the same but i was wrong so far it is doing ok and i hope it keeps that way for a long time or i will put it in the dumpster\n",
      "i have an ipad 4 tried the kindle fire hd 7-inch and have owned at least 6 kindle and other readers for me the ipad is just too heavy to use comfortably it is tiring and annoying in any position check the specs  this 8.0 is actually lighter than the kindle fire hd 7-inch the kindle hd has better sound but i wouldn't use either device for anything that needs audio without earbuds it is the perfect size and weight for a personal device i was really surprised how much difference the 8-inch screen makes over the 7-inch i can use the browser(s comfortably where the 7-inch was almost unreadable note that the aspect ratio is wider than the ipad so you're getting a much more usable screen for many purposes especially browsing and watching videos most of the screen of the ipad at least my 8.9 inch is completely wasted for movies  large black bars above and below note if you want to download movies google play only lets you store them on the device which is pretty nearly useless since there are only about 9 or 10 gb left out of 16 gb i immediately added a 64 gb class 10 sdhc card but google and samsung don't use it the only movie service i've found that downloads movies or tv to sd is vudu i highly recommend it unless anyone can suggest an alternative.i was concerned that this device might be slower than the kindle fire hd or the galaxy_note 8.0 but i cannot see any lag and surfing seems very good and plenty fast i'm getting over 20 mbps download speeds using the gist test tool and fios unless you specifically need the drawing features of the note i think you'll be pleased with the tab 3 8-inch.one criticism i found that the auto brightness default on the tab 3 8.0 was far too dim for indoor use and i was adjusting manually instead download lux free and you can change those characteristics for me i added two links with lux 1 lux=25 bright and 400 lux=80 bright it now works perfectly\n",
      "added 8/25/2013 i have to apologize for not correcting this review earlier regarding hdmi as far as i have been able to determine the tab 3 8.0 does not have hdmi out at all even with an adapter while hdmi is a nice feature its lack is not a deal breaker for me since i would rarely use it.added 7/30/2013 if anyone needs a nice carrying case not cover check out a rip offs co-58 it is the perfect size for the tab 3 8.0 even in a moko cover and has a couple of small pockets on the front just right for otg adapter flash drives usb cables etc co is clip on bl-58 has a belt loop i mainly use it for packing everything together and adding a little extra protection when i travel.added later on 7/19/2013 does anyone else find the micro usb port difficult to plug into i sent my firt tab 3 back because i could not get either the cable that came with it or any of the many i own to even start to plug in when i got a replacement i was able to get the factory cable and most others plugged in but a couple still won't go in at all they work fine on the many other micro usb devices i own.following up my comments about usb keyboard below i found an app called external keyboard helper that reprograms some usb keyboard keys such as the esc key to emulate the android back button and shift+alt esc to emulate the home button like holding home holding shift+alt esc displays open apps it also works with most bluetooth keyboards.original post:i deleted my earlier pre-delivery post rather than update it i am thrilled with the features i mentioned in the title they are the only things that kept my tab 2 7 from being nearly perfect for me i have grown to hate proprietary connectors as they limit your choices of available adapters now i i like to have hdmi out capability for travel the tab 2 does not have this capability period even with an adapter i am very happy the side bezels have been narrowed the tab 3 8 is only 07 wider than tab 2 7 which is nothing and only 5 longer 8 screen and not much bigger overall even in a case i can slip it in my pocket if i need to 8 vs 7 is a huge difference for the last 4 years i spent a couple of hours a day on a 7 netbook then a 10.1 so i am very comfortable with the 8 though i will still use my new 11.6 netbook most of the time other reviewers have done a great job praising the many features of the tab 3 8.0 so i will limit my review to try to flesh out some of its usb capabilities.i immediately tried this micro usb otg adapter and a flash drive:t  s electronics micro usb[[asin:b000q8uawy belkin usb 2.0 4-port ultra-mini hubotg cable  lifetime warranty micro usb otg to usb adapter samsung galaxy_s4 htc one nexus 7  nexus 10 galaxy_tab 3 and all otg compatible devices the tab 3 read the drive just fine next i unmounted the flash drive and plugged in this belkin ultra mini usb hub:belkin usb 2.0 4-port ultra-mini huband re-inserted the flash drive still good then i plugged in a usb keyboard and mouse and all three devices were fully functional now the piece de resistance using this y cable,apricorn usb power adapter y cable ausb-y usb black/grey i connected a 2.5 external hard drive to the hub and a usb power adapter you could use the tab 3's the tab 3 recognized it but could not read the ntfs file system i am certain a drive formatted fat32 would work fine using the n_xus fill in an e photo viewer app i could read the drive but could only open photos there is a paid version of the app that may allow more access this was just a test unfortunately the only apps to fully read ntfs seem to require root.i have an hdmi adapter for my galaxy_note phone that i will try as soon as i can and report back.that's about it for now except that i am typing this using the usb keyboard and mouse connected to the belkin hub sometimes the onscreen keyboard will pop up and consume half the screen a right click on the mouse closes it oh the only minor thing that may have been better on the tab 2 is that because the menu home return buttons were soft buttons you could click on them with the mouse on the tab 3 those are hard buttons that are off the screen so you cannot access them by mouse i am going to search to see if there are keyboard or mouse alternatives\n",
      "there are too many tablets these days right samsung's third generation of galaxy_tab series is highly anticipated and for this price point phenomenal i have been using galaxy_tab 2 and i will compare and contrast here i played around with review units of all sizes and i have since returned them i liked the tab 8 so much i purchased 2 for myself and my family my reviews are unbiased and neutral 7 and 8 are ideal for plane trips long journeys i had used a 7 tablet on a long journey to listen to songs and read epub books aldiko and it was a very pleasant experience 7 form factor is lightweight compact and great if you are a bit experienced and can afford it i recommend the 8 samsung has made 8 and 7 almost same weight in my opinion 8 is the maximum value for the money and features and hence i gave 8 a 5 star i am personally getting the 8 version i gave 7 a 4 star but no means undermining it i gave the 10 also a 4 star because of some strange feature limitations'.samsung has introduced 7 8 and 10.1 of the tab 3 series they are entering all form factors as i know they have something in 4 5 6 7 8 10 lines woo all of the 7 8 10 galaxy_tabs come in white and golden brown color my preference is white color looks pretty!let's start off with salient points of all of the galaxy_tab 3 series in previous version of tab 2 there was simply no 8 form factor so i will compare with note 8 later.7-inch tablet 1024 x 600 marvell dual-core 1.2ghz processor 1gb ram and 8gb storage or rom a microsd card slot upto 64 gb camera 3mp rear-facing 1.3mp

could be upgraded as next version android 5 key lime pie currently targeted for oct 2013 key lime pie's one of the main touting points is compatibility to avoid fragmentation so i can foresee all of these models being able to upgrade if google keeps their promise.the 8 has a physical home button so are others in the series also has capacitive back and menu buttons 64 gb sd card is awesome with prices plummeting for 64 gb cards it is a great boon put all your music books photos on the sd card and you have a powerful computer in hand always i personally use the 64 gb microsd card on my mobile devices get this mobileultra sandisk 64gb mobile ultra microsdxc class 6 memory card with sd adapter  retail packaging.best thing about tab 3 8.0 is how holdable it is it's narrower than the galaxy_note 8.0 but in every other way including lightness comfortable curves and screen brightness it feels the same there is a 100 prices difference between tab 3 7 and tab 3 8 if that matters get a tab 3 7in otherwise 8 is more portable and lightweight compared to 10 the galaxy_note 2 as well as ipad mini are same form factors as this one there are other reasons to pick the 8-incher over the 7.0 the larger tab 3 gets android 4.2 instead of 4.1 1280 x 800 resolution twice as much 16gb internal storage and 1.5gb of ram.the comparison with 8 note are note 8 is slightly heavier 338 grams compared to 309 grams of tab 8 each gram matters for long holding from cpu processor perspective note has a quad-core 1.6 ghz cortex-a9 versus dual-core 1.5 ghz of tab 2 8 resolution same on both 1280 x 800 pixels 8.0 inches 189 ppi pixel density the tab has  dolby surround sound enhancement it does sound good the note has no such mention and i am sure does not have dolby enhancement note 8 has 2 gb ram compared to 1.5 gb here both have bluetooth 4.0 and have usb host capability usb host is one of the most under noticed features of androids and is in my opinion one of the best features compared to ipad lines what this means you get a usb host cable also otherwise called otg on the go cables and plug in your usb thumb drive or other usb devices and the device recognizes it i have used it with alfa awus036h for a wireless project with android pcap capture from reputable kismet wireless both have same camera 5 mp 2560&#1093;1920 pixels and 720p@30fps another much ignored feature is the tv-out via mhl a/v link 8 and 10.1in supports it whereas 7in does not you can connect galaxy_devices to a tv to make it truly a fantastic computer if mhl is supported throw in a bluetooth keyboard and it is awesome leo laporte's twit tv which is internet based show has one full episode in know how on covering this topic battery on note 8 is slightly bigger non-removable li-ion 4600 mah battery than 4450 mah on tab 3 which is not a big difference.believe me don't get mired in the spec game samsung is creating markets for all form factors and i would consider this as an exploratory stage just like ford or toyota has cars in different shapes sizes and price range so are the tablet vendors now remember the laptop wars 10 12 13 15 17 and even some 19 if i remember right few years ago we used to debate endlessly which laptop sizes are better which has better speakers and so on the time has come to fight it out for tablets i would say go from budget and size if budget is not a concern i would say go for samsung tab 8 i am usually not a big fan of 10 8 is a sweet spot if budget is a concern tab 3 7 is awesome otherwise get the tab 8 10 is marketed for specific segments in business who use for spreadsheets presentations remote desktop like citrix gotomeeting gps was spot on and i tried multiple gps apps it was bright outdoors had to crank the brightness all the way up i personally use navigon from garmin and have downloaded several apps.i tried following apps and they just worked awesome a tablet is only as good as the apps you have how productive it makes you it's almost like the camera/lens analogy in the dslr space what good it is to have a great dslr body if you have no good lens same with tablet body and apps you have.wolframalpha i can go on for hours praising this this

      "item was purchased as a secondary charging cord for home for my wives samsung galaxy_note 10.1 tablet purchased this item so that i could leave one charging cord in a travel pouch for periods of travel item worked as described and is made of good quality materials\n",
      "i've been trying to get a replacement cord for my galaxy_note 2 10.1 it has to be a very specific cord and plug or they don't work the original and 2 i got from verizon have both stopped working with in months of getting them i got one from another company with an awsome long cord but it didn't last very long i tried another from amazon but it isn't compatible and you get the red x when charging finding the right thing is frustrating whats the deal samsung anyway after the reviews on this one and such a great price i bought 2 they both work great some times the plug gets very warm so don't know if that's a good thing but so far so good i hope they will last longer than a couple months\n",
      "got this extra cable for my samsung galaxy_note 10.1 car charger bought it directly from amazon.com so i know for sure this is not a knockoff one works perfectly highly recommended to everyone\n",
      "there are many of us who have problems charging our samsung galaxy_note 10.1 and i was one of them all of a sudden my tablet would not take a charge i still had the lightning bolt on the battery icon and when off i had the large moving blue battery everything seemed normal except it wouldn't charge i spent days reading the tech stuff and forums on the topic and came to the conclusion that samsung tablets have problems some people could find fixes and others could not while i was waiting for this cable to arrive i tried other suggestions but nothing worked thankfully this cable was what i needed it's exactly like the original so it must be oem i ordered it through u-like and it arrived in two business days even though i did not buy second day shipping.highly recommended\n",

      "i am a big fan of samsung products and i currently own the galaxy_note 3 and the original note 10.1 tablet when the 2014 edition of the note came out i was eager to explore the high resolution screen and the many features that make the note such a great tablet being aware that the note pro 12.2 is about to be released boasting of a larger screen size and a more windows-like display i seriously thought of waiting to check out this larger tablet however trying to be practical the note 2014 for me lighter-weight and slightly smaller in size not screen size though the portability of the tablet is really important to me i bought the tablet a couple of days ago and am quite impressed and very happy with this product i was able to sync the tablet through my samsung account with much help from my tech-savvy son and to my surprise was able to get all my saved s-notes onto my new tablet an app called file manager a free download from the play store was needed and well utilized in making this transition possible and on the samsung website an s-note reader program can be downloaded for free onto any pc allowing you to read your s-notes on your computer again all credit goes to my son whose patience for this is extraordinary a lot of trial and error initially along with some scary i thought i lost all my s-notes and frustrating moments it all worked out well in the end i have barely begun to explore the many new and improved features of this tablet and i was quite satisfied with the original note 10.1 which i happily passed along to my son i rely heavily on the s-note application to take many notes create many folders etc both for business use primarily and for personal use as well i love the s-pen which now i cannot live without while always attracted to the ipad with retina display the lack of note-writing capability on the ipad and most other tablets is a big disadvantage to me the surface pro was also something i seriously considered but with enough windows computers and being i am so very comfortable with the note i am sticking with this tablet i also purchased the specially designed samsung cover/case for this tablet which i am also very happy with it is really slick-looking and when you lift the cover open it wakes up the tablet all necessary ports are conveniently exposed the screen resolution is beautiful text is so easy to read and videos stand out beautifully i was also able to install adobe flash player from the adobe website which for me just makes life a lot easier all the apps i had installed on my original note 10.1 were automatically placed on the new tablet once i set it up wi-fi connections work very well also so i have no complaints so far i will update this review if i come across any issues but so far so good if you like samsung products i would highly recommend this tablet hope you enjoy it as much as i do\n",
      "let me say that i'm coming from an asus transformer pad infinity tf-700t that tablet was quite possibly the largest pos on the planet now...having said that...the samsung galaxy_note 10.1 2014 edition is incredible i love this tablet it is lag free has i incredible screen the s pen features are very cool in all this is a lightweight compact full size full power android tablet that kicks the ipad air's behind only negatives i have for it is that is doesn't come with swype and it does take a bit of time to fully charge other than that there is nothing this tablet cannot do it is amazing app to app is very fast multi window is very cool and useful the s pen screen write is a very cool feature the action note is great and the hand writing recognition is nothing short of amazing my handwriting is awful and it picks up a vast majority of the writing i love my new tablet and you will too it is definitely worth the price it delivers on all it promises and samsung has produced a fabulous tablet also i have the mk1 firmware from the factory and have no lag and also have multi user support buy this....you will not be disappointed\n",
      "update 1/11/2014 i just want to add a tip that someone gave me in a comment to another note 10.1 2014 review in the review that follows i complain that android is not really conducive to developing and editing spreadsheets that's true  for me at least but the tip was to work spreadsheets with the tablet in portrait position rather than landscape that really does help.update 12/3/2013 first of all i've downgraded my rating to 4 stars  for the same reasons many have commented on i just don't find the problems to be as large or as tedious of some do and i get a lot more benefits from my note 10.1 than i have issues so i would really say a 4+.the biggest issue is that the note hand writing translation is not anywhere near perfect and does actually have a few naughty problems that will at times slow you down i find you need to learn how to write on the note for example it has difficulty between my i l  and even  or  as i get more meticulous the better the result my tt is done with three strokes not four the note seems to have learned how to handle that good stray spaces or overwrites tend to happen and mostly surprise me and require correction but at times the note just correctly interprets the same input strange!)so for me who uses the note to communicate with others not just to take notes for myself and who tends to perfectionism on spelling and punctuation there is a certain amount of frustration and correction that i shouldn't have to do i should point out that 45 years ago in college i learned to print fast because i couldn't read my own writing when it came time to review/study i haven't tested note with my writing but frankly i shudder.)so why a 4-star review i love it with some minimal correcting i generally get what i want properly entered with the s-pen and i feel no need for a real keyboard despite being an excellent typist i much prefer the s-pen over poking the screen keyboard those who complain about lag even with touchwiz clearly are not getting all the samsung updates or may have other issues incidently as a new samsung user i like touchwiz and have not felt a need to replace it i also just got a new samsung galaxy_s4 and naturally there is almost no learning curve despite touchwiz android 4.3 is simple android 4.3 don't bother me with complaints otherwise.the screen is great the size is perfect for me where the nexus 7 was just too small the feel is good and after 3 weeks i still don't understand why people complain so vehemently about accidentally pressing fixed button or soft keys some adaptability in life is a good thing i won't say that accidental key presses have not happened but no more than using my 6 year old laptop still getting occasional use).the speakers puke but that's why i bought a logitech bluetooth speaker for my nexus 7 i use my devices for music access not for quality sound you need to find your own sound quality a photographer or a smartphone owner may not want to use the onboard camera but it is definitely useful at times with reasonable results.my other use for a note is for woodworking design the is no replacement for sketchup  that's the only software for which i need to find an adroid option however some limited use of the s-note and sketchpad have been very promising and hand drawings are basically how i start everything and sometimes the only thing i use.i'm a retired programmer/project manager and now have only an irregular need for a full computer system though i have been dependent on a pc and then a laptop for more than 30 years until 3 weeks ago my laptop still suffices when needed but i've hardly used it at all since getting the note my biggest issue is with the extensive spreadsheets that i would like to be able to use edit and update on the note spreadsheets in general are not well supported by the note software or any other android software that i have found spreadsheets are not pure text input and samsung or someone else should provide a cell based input means that doesn't cover half the visible spreadsheet with an input area so there is some spreadsheet utility but at this point i still must go to the laptop for major updates.i don't see that as particularly a samsung problem although they could and should certainly provide the solution the android spreadsheet software is just lacking for advanced work most of the function is there but as i said the interface is weak this typically would only affect me about 3  4 times a year my spreadsheets have 10 years of development and use in them for budget management i can still see my results including the graphical analysis and do limited inputs with what is available on android.so this spreadsheet limitation is the one item that prevents me from completely replacing a windows based computer with the note 10.1 it may not work for others others may feel more limited it may be necessary to adapt to new software and techniques cloud usage but i am very satisfied with the note improved s-pen software and a good spreadsheet interface would complete my requirements.i've never been an apple user though in my technical days did involve early macs i'm in the camp that the the ipad bigots should get over it if you like your device fine it's not better than mine for my purposes  i like to be able to manage my own device.(it suddenly strikes me to say that my usage has almost nothing to do with media entertainment interesting!)(begin original thoughts:)it's hard to add any to the good reviews that have already been made so mostly i'll first recommend that you read the first 5  8 reviews under the default most helpful first sort at the end of this preliminary review i'll add the many suggestions i collected from reading all the reviews and comments  that should help some of you who are new or still trying to learn and i strongly recommend that anyone watch the 48 minute youtube review that i have posted as a comment there is more good information and orientation in that video than you'll find in maybe any other.despite some dissenters on this idea i'm using the note 10.1 as a replacement for my venerable win7 on sony vaio laptop the laptop is beginning to show it's age and wear after 6 years still runs better than my wife's new lenovo twist with win8 i've been using a nexus 7 for the past year and this note is much nicer.so related to this laptop replacement one question i have up front is whether any of those who rate this tablet at 5 or 4 either have or plan to get a bluetooth keyboard to use with it at this point i'm not in a rush but as a typist a keyboard can be nice for me the keyboard would stay in my living room like my laptop does  i definitely will use the note and stylus for portability and convenience edit you can get a keyboard but i now don't think it is necessary.)the most difficult concern with this tablet is it's complexity i've commented about this in a number of other reviews after that concern there is a nice feature that got in the way  once you follow the introductory setup if you already have had a tablet the note will go out to google and/or samsung and start downloading your configuration and apps nice it took several hours to get all mine from my nexus 7 but interferes with getting the new updates from samsung.as others said there are currently three updates which eliminate the lag and add multi-tasking if your new note is clean you will have no issues with doing a factory reset after getting those updates as some recommend but if you spent hours getting your apps in place you probably won't want to start again from scratch after a factory reset despite that wanting to be sure i had the best possible performance i decided to do the factory reset  after all it was just a matter or waiting for all those downloads again as i hadn't really done any special customization.in the end i found that doing the factory reset didn't seem to provide any better performance for me  it was great before and after with no lag i suspect that those who did get an improvement had not downloaded all 3 updates before they did a reset can anyone confirm or deny that edit max posted agreement with this thanks max.)so now i'm into seriously configuring this thing since the nexus 7 doesn't have a memory card slot all my apps were downloaded into the note main storage any suggestions on what and how to best transfer stuff to the 64 gig microchip i assume some apps will run better from main storage i plan to put all my data music and pics on the microchip.i'm not having problems or lag with touchwiz but i'll try another launcher and post about that later edit not sure now that i will actually bother  touchwiz is fine for me.)so that's my preliminary rating based on the fact that everything i've done and tried out has gone well and the device itself appears to be in perfect condition i'll edit this in a couple of weeks to update my experience but up front i totally disagree with the review that complained extensively about the poor build quality sure it's plastic but the fit and finish is great nothing appears to be loose or vibrates.i also want to comment about the experience i had with amazon on the shipping ups completely screwed it up and reported the tablet as delivered on time even though i never saw it the first amazon csr seemed to get things all taken care up but i didn't get any followup after i called back again the support team worked together to first of all ensure i got to someone who would take care of the problem and each person involved took responsibility to see that the handoffs were completed properly not ideal but i got my note 10.1 with only a small delay.___________ok these are the suggestions i gleaned from the reviews and comments of others feel free to use or not as you choose  these items are copied as found from different people so they are a bit disjointed and redundant:note there is an update from samsung dated november 1 that adds multi-user and resolves most of the sluggishness issues go to settings/general/about device/software update to get it mine did not automatically update.if you continue to have issues you should do a factory reset after installing the newest update for the device to check for updates manually go to about device in options.before you start using the device i highly suggest doing a factory reset after you've updated to the latest firmware.if you are still complaining about lag i would recommend downloaded a custom launcher like nova launcher.nova is good but i've always liked apex better with apex i turned on tablet ui mode which makes it look like stock android no bottom bar no dock app drawer icon in upper right square-outline tablet animation for panning desktop etc i love stock android so for me apex in tablet-ui mode is great.after getting rid of touchwiz for shame samsung and putting nova launcher prime on it it ran great.cons samsung overlays android with their system touchwiz it has its good but it has its bad like major memory hog i'd recommend using one of the launchers such as nova launcher for a more customization of an experienceusb host is one of the most undernoticed features of androids and is in my opinion one of the best features compared to ipad lines what this means you get a usb host cable also otherwise called otg on the go cables and plug in your usb thumb drive or other usb devices and the device recognizes it.another much ignored feature is the tv-out via mhl a/v link unfortunately the 7 does not support it whereas 8in and 10.1 in supports it you can connect galaxy_devices to a tv to make it truly a fantastic computer if the device supports mhl throw in a bluetooth keyboard and it is awesome.google music awesome i have now upto 10,000 songs halfway through google's 20k limit)for flash capabilities i use a web browser called dolphin browser there are others out there for flash capabilities but i prefer dolphin for its speed and stability after installing dolphin browser which allows flash player to be enabled i've essentially turned this tablet into a laptop in terms of internet web browsing capabilities to allow the dolphin browser to have its flash option work you must download an android 4.0's version of flash on the tablet anyone version will do google android flash player archives and proceed to the adobe site flash has no longer made anymore updates for android devices therefore you must do it this way go to dolphin browser hit menu hit settings turn on flash and now you have flash capabilities on your dolphin browser no other browser has flash capability as of now i must tell you it is a pleasure to watch amazon prime videos using the dolphin browser and at the same time multi-task with another browser like chrome to read stuff on the internet or use s note on the right side while watching a video for class on the left side.lag issues can be improved read here turn on developer options by tapping build number found in the about section within options 7 times once developer options are turned on scroll down to window animation transition animation animator duration and turn each one off you will notice no more lag for scrolling and exiting apps.to solve the home button issue where there is lag go to s voice once in s voice hit the menu button which is located left of the home button choose the option to not initiate s voice by double tapping the home button you will notice considerable changes in speed of the home button to wake up the screen however it won't be snappy until there is an update.in addition the more apps you have on your device the more cache data your device will accumulate just like your web browser you should remove your app cache data once a day or every few days to save up space i suggest avg memory and cache cleaner or clean master tips to extend battery life go to the wifi options and select to turn wi-fi off when device is asleep in addition turn off gps located by networks in the network location options turn on gps only for location.-the touchwiz gallery app is terrible it draws thumbnails every time you open the app so if you have lots of photos it hangs/lags sot bad that it can render the device unusable.[i use quickpic and it handles everything fine](for people that dont have 4k photos you will still likely need to disable weather/buddy tagging dropbox photo displaying google photo syncing/displaying facebook photo syncing/sharing and clear the app cache for the gallery to get decent performance from the stock gallery if you have the galaxy_note phone transitioning to this tablet is super easy in that the user interface is practically the same and once you link your google account it automatically downloads all compatible apps to your device for you you'll still need to download amazon apps individually but you'll need to allow downloads from unknown sources to get them.i will say there are some things you won't discover right away settings that are buried in other menus and menus that you discover in apps after days of using them.many application features are difficult to discover always press the menu button just in case!turn off the news/home button association by pressing the menu button while the news is on screen you'll see the option to turn it off there.the s-note can go into what i'd call note-only mode meaning neither menu bar nor tool bar shows only the 100 pure note so you can literally use it just like using a regular note.(after going into the edit mode with 3 fingers tab on the screen holding onto it for about 1 second and then release and it will go into that note-only mode and write freely without having to worry about accidentally touching a menu button and then tabbing with 3 fingers on the screen twice will exit you out of that mode back to the regular edit mode).i've only had it a few days and the first thing i did was download nova launcher program it to remote my tv and to prevent possible lag went into settings general about device tapped build number 7 x's this opens the developer options tab then under drawing turned off transition animation scale you can go to youtube and watch this tutorial presented by thedigitaldigest great series of helpful tutorials for tablet neophytesto learn more about the note 10.1 2014 edition here is a link to a youtube video on samsung mobile's page  even better to me this is the long thorough review that shows almost everything there is to know

      "i have used all three devices  galaxy_note vs ipad air vs kindle hdx 8.9  for several months and each device has it own pros and cons based on how you use the device and what you'd like to do with it the samsung note gives a pretty decent experience overall and excels on many features and from then on it's a matter of preference.i still prefer my ipad for magazine/text book/newspaper reading due to it's shape that makes it easy i also find it the best for surfing the internet although galaxy_note is not far behind kindle's silk browser is slooow and i would never use it chrome works fine on all and you can change the settings to use chrome.ipad is also my tablet of choice for sketching apps the galaxy_tab comes with a pen but i don't find it as responsive as ipad for my sketching although it might just be because i am more used to the ipad with a stylus i can't even think about the same on kindle as the interface seems slow and unresponsive it's improved quite a bit with kindle hdx but there is still ways to go.for watching movies i prefer kindle hdx 8.9 as it's the lightest of the three and has the best resolution and streaming is pretty seamless the sound is perhaps the best of all devices but if you're using headphones it doesn't matter galaxy_note and ipad make the chromecast streaming pretty seamless unlike the kindle hdx so if you're using your tablet to watch a movie on another screen keep that in mind.when you're holding the tablet the weight really makes a difference and for this reason i like to read books on my kindle hdx 8.9 although nothing beats the kindle paperwhite for reading novels.another thing about galaxy_tab is that it's convenient to have a pen right on the tablet the pen offers many point and click functions but i just wish they were a little more user friendly and unobstrusive so far i prefer to use my finger unless i am using a specific app that requires the pen i was excited about the feature that turns handwriting to typed text but in reality it has a learning curve and is still not very intuitive right now i don't see an advantage over ipad if you're using a good stylus.if you're considering how to decide between ipad and galaxy the first thing you have to consider is the eco-system if you've been using an android phone the transition to galaxy_note is seamless but if you're an iphone owner you may find the android interface not as user friendly as it's not as simple and intuitive but offers more flexibility if you have many apps that you love and use on ios for example the garage band or imovie then you may want to buy the ipad  these apps are now free with ipad air.the other thing to consider is storage and importing files the galaxy_note allows you to put in a mini sd card to expand storage that makes also it very convenient to access files on the galaxy however with dropbox and direct streaming from many sites the need for expanded storage is diminished there are also now many products out there that function that don't need wifi to create a network expand storage on the ipad.the kindle hdx has a closed eco-system that does not allow any outside apps like nook ibooks in books or music from itunes i am especially frustrated by not being able to read my magazines in one place as there are separate apps required for each magazine ipad's newstand integrates all magazine apps for one seamless experience kindle hdx is most useful if you have more content from amazon but it's cheaper and has a pretty decent email interface and a free office app so it can be used as a multi-purpose device it also has a send to kindle feature that allows you to print any doc to your kindle i love that feature.overall the galaxy_note is a very useful device with the most features of all three and is the most flexible however i use it the least my main tablet usage is surfing the internet reading magazines/newspapers watching movies/tv editing photos and the ipad is still my go-to device due to it's shape speed and app eco-system kindle hdx is next for it's video-viewing and all the content i have from amazon samsung galaxy_note though versatile is not my go-to device for any one thing  so it loses out however it comes the closest to a pc replacement if i did more office work on my tablet so i still like having it around especially when i travel.the galaxy_note came with a ton of freebies like google play and samsung store credit expanded dropbox for 2 years boingo membership for one year businessweek subscription for a year hulu plus membership for 3 months which was very nice no other device offered all these freebies so if they're still being offered when you buy the tablet factor that into the cost\n",
      "i have been using the new galaxy_note10.1 2014 now for about three weeks ever since i traded in my aging ios device an ipad 3.i am blown away by the beautiful ultra hd display which far exceeds any clarity and color of any tablet i have seen blows retina away!the s pen let's me be naturally creative as i would with a pencil on paper as it responds well and handles almost flawless to transcribe what i write as text into typed text from taking notes to searching in the url box to the new ingenious twitter application that let's me write or draw tweets the ability to open multi windows is a great new experience from the decaying stagnant features on my old tablet not only can you open two apps and work between them at the same time but you can also open two windows with the same app such as 2 websites or 2 emails and you can even draw another window or 2 or 3 on top of those windows to watch youtube or bring up a calculator and more!the one gripe i have is because of its advanced specs some of the software especially touchwiz related items does not seem to be optimized for these higher specs and tend not to run as smoothly as they do on the s4 or tab3 there are also some game apps that falter or slow down for some reason like simpson's tapped out when they work fine on my other galaxy_products i don't know if they just haven't been updated for android 4.3 which is standard on this device or if they just can't keep up with the tablet's specs i hope samsung releases an update to speed up these issues and that kit kat 4.4 is planned for this monster of a tablet soon!i highly recommend this tablet samsung makes it easier to switch from other formats such as apple's ios to android than some of the other manufacturers that just give you vanilla android.i made the switch earlier this year when the s4 was released and it was a lot easier than i thought it would be...i did not lose functionality or choices of productive apps but actually gained a lot more and also can customize my device to reflect my taste not some hot shot designer in an ivery tower telling me the way my device should look and function you can also expand this device's storage by an additional 64gb with a micro sd card!highly recommend this tablet for anyone who likes to be creative or productive and enjoys the freedom to have the additional input that the s pen provides!********************note there is an update from samsung dated november 1 that adds multi-user and resolves most of the sluggishness issues go to settings/general/about device/software update to get it mine did not automatically update\n",
      "pros:1 screen is very very good the best screen i've seen on any tablet period!2 love the inclusion of micro sd card support so i can expand my memory3 generally significantly faster than the older note 10.14 speakers are nice and loud5 the camera is okay but doesn't appear to be nearly as good as that of the first galaxy_tab 10.1 or 8.06 love the multitasking features but this needs to be expanded to support every app not just a select few7 the s pen is awesome this single innovation makes it the most functional tablet for me8 s note is also a great app9 build quality is very good the tablet feels solid and premium i love the faux leather back10 the battery is significantly better than that of the older note 10.1 it should easily last an entire day with moderate to heavy use11 multitasking is awesome you can open multiple apps at the same time this make is so much more functionalcons:1 s note too slow for my liking and even slower than in old note 10.12 s note and s memo need to be merged like they were on the old note 10.13 software needs to be optimized to run faster and more smoothly yes there's lag on this device the intermittent lag doesn't render it unusable to any extent but it's annoying to say the least hopefully a software update eliminates this.4 battery life could use some improvement better than the old note 10.1 though)5 the menu back and home buttons arrangement is terrible and gets in the way all the time they should revert to virtual buttons like on the older galaxy_note 10.1 the virtual buttons worked perfectly well why screw up something that's not broken\n",
      "the wife had an older 15&#34 laptop running vista that we were going to replace with one of the smaller ultrabooks i started thinking through the process  realized she spends far more time on her galaxy_note 2 than her laptop so i started looking at the larger tablets i have a 7&#34  knew she wouldn't be happy with one that small this is one expensive tablet but the screen is unbelievably sharp  now she won't have to learn a new version of windows she loves it so i'm happy\n",
      "as a self-proclaimed 34;apple&#34 guy i was very skeptical of getting a samsung product i am so used to operating apple's products such as my macbook and iphone but all things considered the ipad is basically a larger iphone and i wanted to mix things up a bit therefore i took a huge chance on the galaxy_note at first operating the tablet was difficult because the operating system was so foreign to me that being said it did not take long at all for me to get used to this device and its absolutely outstanding features.the speech recognition works incredibly well when searching the tablet or verbally inputing text also one of the main features of this tablet the s pen makes this tablet easier to understand thanks to the air view features which when hovering over certain icons with the s pen gives a useful and brief description of the icon on the screen the s pen also allows artistic users to write/draw personal notes and artworks as well as write to input text the battery life lasts for a while and does not take as long to charge as other tablets that i have had experiences with i.e the nexus 7 and apple ipad the multi-window feature makes multitasking simple and the accessibility options make the tablet's operations more personal and convenient to each user's standards and of course samsung's 34;smart screen&#34 features only further increase the convenience of this tablet why take the time to pause a video when you can just look away if you are for instance reading with a tablet the screen timeout may beat you before you can flip to the next page but with smart screen all a user has to do is continue to look at the screen for it to stay active various motions and voice commands also make this tablet wonderful to navigate don't feel like hitting the snooze button on your tablet's alarm just say 34;snooze&#34 or 34;stop.&#34 samsung has integrated so many useful features into this tablet.while the note 2014 edition packs a punch with its features fear not it also has wonderful aesthetics the packs are made of a sturdy plastic material with a leather-bound look the screen images are typically extremely clear and almost lifelike.i personally worry about storage often due to my love of music pictures and applications i purchased the 32gb note 2014 edition but should i run out of storage space it is comforting to know that i can easily remedy this issue by inserting a micro-sd card into my note.with all of these wonderful aspects in mind i have found a few minor flaws with the samsung galaxy_note 10.1 2014 edition on a few occasions my tablet has briefly frozen or randomly returned me to the home screen also integrating my music photos and contacts from my computer was a bit of a hassle at times and it took me some time to finally get everything settled those flaws being said i could almost always google any questions or issues that i had to find a solution if i could go back i would undoubtedly purchase the note over an ipad it just has too many amazing features and characteristics that put other tablets to shame\n",
      "i bought this product mainly to replace my notebooks for notetaking during lectures.so far so good i've been using the s notes to take hand written notes and have been excited to see how well it looks like actual hand writing i can also write very small and the tablet will still recognize what i write it pretty much mimics the paper and pen very well the only down side with this is that i take notes with tablet while it's in a horizontal orientation thus i have to scroll down once i fill up the screen this is not a big problem since s notes uses a program that will only recognize the stylus for writing so you can use your finger to easily scroll down the page while taking notes.the tablet keeps up with your writing very well it also can sense pressure.i've looked at the windows 8 tablets like surface pro 2 and thinkpad tablet 2 they also come with a stylus and take notes very well however they both cost over a thousand dollars they are worth every penny though since onenotes is pretty much the best note taking application on the market and has it's full features only for windows computers however i wasn't willing to spend that much on a machine i would use primarily to take notes on so a galaxy 10.1 is a great deal for me.i've also rooted the device and disabled all the junk apps samsung preinstalled it with this has made the tablet run much faster i've made sure to disable all the knox apps too.battery life is pretty much amazing it will last a whole day no doubt if you don't get the case for it the tablet doesn't do a good job of gripping to the surface you place it on even with the fake leather material on that back it still can slide off a surface that is at an incline easy fix if you just buy a case that has better friction.i've heard that a galaxy_note 12.2 edition is coming out next year so you might want to hold off buying this if you want an even bigger screen one that actually is the size of a piece of paper this would be great to take notes on like i said scrolling for me is not a problem with the 10.1 though.design wise this thing is pretty nice even though it's mostly plastic this allows for the tablet to be lighter.the people who complain about that lag are sort of right it doesn't lag much but a few rare times i will see some stuttering for people who complain about exiting apps being too slow go to s voice go into settings and uncheck the box open via home key closing apps is slow because samsung is waiting for a double press on the homekey so that it can open s voice once you disable that function exiting apps will be fast.i'll update in a few months to see how well this tablet does.edit after a few months)snotes sucks it lags and crashes i've found a much better app lecturenotes pretty much the same as snotes but doesn't crash and is supported heavily by the developer.the two touch buttons on the bottom of the screen is a real pain since you can accidentally touch them while writing solution when using lecturenotes rotate the tablet upside-down so that the you can't touch the buttons.battery is still fantastic a good pro for this device.still using it heavily as a note taking device has not failed the pen has also still lasted me no problems thus far.the 12.2 note did come out go check it out on amazon and see if you should get it.love this tablet to death looks great dropped it once from 3 feet didn't crack but the corner got scratched\n",
      "i got my samsung galaxy_note 10.1&#34 2014 edition one week ago intent was to transition my ipad to my wife who is comfortable with her iphone and me to adopt the galaxy_note as i really like my galaxy_s3 phone and am looking for maximum compatibility i have been exceptionally pleased more and more i belive that the apple products while they do have some very nice features just seem to lock you out of too many things for example try transporting your apple address book somewhere else good luck with that the google address book gives you so much more flexibility and power.the screen on the galaxy_note is incredible the form factor being a little wider is also generally very nice some aps although do not scale quite as well to this  for example my application to read the san diego union tribune seems to be sized more for the ipad  not a huge deal though.the internet browser on the galaxy_note seems superior to me it just works better and seems to support more websites and particularly video formats that you can not view on the ipad.love how you can install your own micro sd memory card in the samsung products you can buy a good quality 64gb microsd for a fraction of what apple charges you to get 64gb of memory.email ap provided with the galaxy_note is very nice and easy to use.gps receiver built in  very nice built-in gps receiver my ipad2 does not have this don't know if the more recent ipads do or not works very well and of course integrates great with hte googlemaps and since this is an android device no problems there you do need wireless access for your maps to update as you move around the country but i did find a free ap that allows you to download maps for free navigator that appears a good option.dropbox  samsung gives you 2 years subscription with 50gb storage to dropbox i am very impressed with the ease of use of dropbox on the samsung galaxy_note as well as my home laptop i can even look up files from my work computer network by just logging into my dropbox account this is very convenient.in general i am thrilled with my galaxy_note 10.1 2014 it is generally very intuitive and i find it to be more powerful in many ways than the ipad did i mention the ability to open a second application to the side or in a subwindow  very convenient at times there are a few drawbacks compared to the apple ipad which i will list below ap support  the application availablity for the galaxy_note is excellent but not as good as for apple if you have a popula ap on your apple device i would estimate an 80 probability the ap will be available on the androis as well but there have been some supriises i have been running an ap on my ipad and galaxy_s3 phone to track my ncaa mens basketball bracket and mysteriously it does not seem to be available for the galaxy_note similarly my glo bible ap is not yet available but they say they are working on it also can't find an ap for amazon prime video although there is one to play amazon prime video on the ipad hopefully amazon will get one available soon for the android music transferability  this is both a negative and a positive if you have all your music in apple itunes it will take a little work to transfer into the android system that said apple itunes i find to be too restrictive and i'm trying to move away from them there are aps and utilities out there that can do this for you picture transferability  apple does a very nice job with it's iphoto program and then transfers all of your albums seamlessly to your ipad and/or iphone that said it appears that google's picasa can now import your iphoto albums i will be trying to make that transition but i do have to complement apple on the ease of use of their iphoto program between their devices.after one week i am thrilled with the samsung galaxy_note and highly recommend it i find it worth the transition away from apple and with just a little bit of work will be more powerful and convenient than the ipad was\n",
      "i bought this at a local store so although not an amazon verified purchase i did purchase this exact 32gb model i had read some mixed reviews and wanted to be able to return it if i was not satisfied and amazon has a strict return policy on tech gear.my major concern was about screen lag that i read about that is not an issue for me i made sure that it had the latest update before installing any apps i also enabled developer mode in settings go to the android build number and tap repeatedly once there i turned off all of the animation effects you may say that i turned off some of the eye candy but i do this even on windows computers i also went into the application manager and turned off a lot of bloatware again that is turning off features but if you do not use them then they are just drains on processing and battery power with that i have seen zero lag applications and menus open instantly the gallery flies when swiping between photos although after testing i did replace the stock gallery with quickpic which gives you much better control over how the gallery works and is free these were some of the performance issues noted online but all are working fine.battery life so far is good i am getting over 7 hours of life with wifi on and watching videos internet using polaris office etc in heavy continuous usage i would expect over 8 hours in airplane mode the screen is gorgeous just expect that what you see will depend upon your source files crappy input files will not be magically fixed high quality photos and videos look incredible videos look best at native size  if you blow up a small video to fullscreen you will see jaggies and artifacts.sound via headphones is just fine the built-in speakers are stereo but they are facing the back of the unit so they sound a bit washed out some cases will make this even worse.i have a galaxy_note 3 phone and had a note 2 before so i am used to the software offerings polaris office is really useful and meets all of my non-work related document needs but will never be a full ms office replacement if you need that get a surface or a laptop but those are different devices with their own pros and cons the s-pen is definitely useful and definitely takes some practice in truth i rarely use it the same with the multi-window functionality they are great for those who need them or want to use and/or play with them yes we are paying a bit extra for those features but not really when you consider that a similar nexus 10 is only 100 less and that is for the previous generation with a screen that is just not as good and without expandable memory micro sd card on the note versus using a usb otg dongle on the nexus and hoping it works yes this comes with android 4.3 instead of 4.4 has touchwiz and an update to 4.4 will be whenever samsung releases one so check out the software before you buy otherwise you are not paying much of a premium over other devices in this class although it is even debatable if there are any in its class).in summary i am very happy with this tablet it is the best i have ever owned which includes both android and apple make sure you are comfortable with android it is different than ios and with the touchwiz changes if those work for you this is an awesome tablet\n",
      "i purchased this tablet as a refurb through woot the first one i received had a bad dent in the top of the tablet right on the top of the volume rocker woot agreed to replace it the second one i received was in like new condition overall i reallly like this tablet since updating it with the new kitkat os the tablet is very responsive and i don't experience any lags that other people reported i did start having video problems with certain feeds with the new os i would get a choppy distorted image and bad pixelation i found that by forcing all video to be rendered by the gpu by enabling the develooper options solved this problem samsung has a bug somewhere and needs to fix this with an update i also wish android and adobe would sort out the flash video fiasco please kill this dead technology and get everyone on to html 5 instead adobe keeps pushing it which makes life miserable for everyone on android and apple devices developers need to be mandated to get off of the flash content as the industry has agreed to move to html5 yes i know you can still use flash on this device but it is a pita to implement.one thing that is very nice is that you can work with two applications on a split screen at the same time on this tablet the downside is that you can only do this with select applications samsung used to have a little tab on the left of the screen to pull the eligible apps out to choose for split screen work once kitkat came out it is now on the right hand side of the screen with no visible tab what i don't like about this is you have applications that you swipe content from right to left and you end up pulling this tab out by accident very annoying they should have left it where it was samsung has media apps that flip pages from right to left  so putting the split screen applications on the right hand side of the screen makes no sense samsung are you listining?the screen image is nice it is not blow me away nice  but the resolution is very good the colors are very accurate for viewing pictures and watching movies it does not use a super amoled screen and in my opinion other screens look better even though this tablet has higher resolution why samsung didn't use a super amoled screen on this expenisve device is questionable the screen is very bright and most of the time i have the brightness at 50 or less.the part i thought i would like the best was the s-pen unfortunatelly to me this is still awkard to use the only pen that works acurately with this tablet is the one that you get with the tablet i can't stand writing with this very thin writing instrument samsung also doesn't give you any replacement nibs for it and it is almost impossible to find them anywhere i tried multiple other thicker oem pens including samsungs own s-pen with eraser for galaxy_note tablets but all of them have a noticeable offset when writing which makes them unuseable for any fine writing work why a vendor can't make a useable aftermarket pen for this device is a mystery to me i e-mailed wacom who apparently makes the pens for samsung but they never responded back to me i wanted to buy their bamboo feel pen as it was wider but too many reviews said it also had this offset issue i guess i won't be buying their pen either so  if you want this for the writing capability plan on using the very thin pen that comes with it and when the nib wears out having to purchase another new pen in fact i'd buy a second one now unless you can find the replacement nibs apparently you can purchase them from samsung directly but i spent an hour on a chat line with samsung service and got no where with them if they do have them i'll bet it is cheaper to buy a whole new pen.writing on the tablet is not like writing with paper and pen i don't care what anyone says in my opinion it is awkward at best and i have been practicing for quite some time lecture notes is the best app available for taking notes on this device but it is difficult to configure and set up once you figure it out it does give you some good functionality it also allows you to record lectures with audio and write notes at the same time samsung has their own apps for taking notes but they could be integrated better and in my opinion are not as good as the lecture notes application hopefully samsung will keep improving their applications for note taking.battery life is acceptable but not great i usually get 1 day of use out of it with heavy use i simply charge it over night so i really don't care how long it takes to charge it has a very big baterry in it to feed a very powerfull processor so it is going to take a while to charge it back up i also hate not being able to replace the battery in these devices you actually can  but you have to watch some youtube videos and do some minor surgery to accomplish this i figure by the time the battery wears out i'll probably want something newer anyway.i do like the media integration that samsung put on this tablet the flip up from bottom of the screen function to receive your news social media etc is very nice samsung also has a magazine/news application included which is very nice and well integrated into the tablet they also include a free trial to zinio for subscribing to magazines i'm sorry but a 10 inch tablet is just not a good reading experience for magazines i find i constantlly have to zoom into the text to read them.i actually like the samsung integrated application launcher and think they did a nice job of making the android experience better don't expect to get much help with learning this tablet i found the information on how to use it is scattered all over the internet most of what i learned i learned from other reviewers of the tablet.the tablet is quite expensive i saved about a hundred bucks buying it refurbished but it still is more expensive than most tablets however when you consider the hardware this has i think it is worth it first you get two sets of quad core processors one set is for high power use and the other one is to save battery life when using applications that don't need the processing speed you get a six core video processor you get 3gb's of internal system ram and 32gb of internal ram i also applaud samsung for letting you use an external micro sd card i have a 64gb card in mine and now 128gb micro cards are coming on the market this will certainly give this tablet longevity allowing me to use it for years.the build quality of the tablet is average it's not bad don't get me wrong its just not great they make a big deal about the stiched leather look on the back but it is just plain old plastic so why bother nothing about the tablet exudes quality to me for the price samsung should have included a case for it and made the actual unit out of metal alloy i purchased the roo leather case which has been great it comes with a very protective leather cover that you can zip the tablet into and has a nice leather wrap around the tablet itself i wanted something that protected the tablet in case i dropped it in my opinion this is the best case for the money as it is all leather.overall i'm very happy with this tablet yes there are some minor issues with it and i still don't think the s-pen is everything it is cracked up to be i hope samsung keeps improving it and comes up with better s-pen functionality.i would highly recommend this tablet but would encourage you to look for discounts as samsung has just announced that it will be replacing these with newer models this summer including super amoled displays plan on paying a premium for these newer models.in summary:pros:very responsive and powerful tablet two sets of quad core processors six core video)3gb of internal system ramhigh screen resolution  best in class)accurate screen colors  very bright screensamsung's app launcher is nicely integrated to make the user experience better than stock android in my opinion.32gb of internal ram can use an external micro sdhc card adding 64gb of user ram 128gb coming)can run two applications at once on the same screen no other tablet can do this today)(however apps that can do this are limited and you have to swipe from right to left to do it which inteferes with other apps even so  being able to have both your e-mail and browser up at the same time is nice even two browser windows at the same time!needs improvement:quality and feel of tablet is mediocre and feels cheap for the money you pay back plastic stiching is cheesy and doesn't fool anyone)s-pen needs improvement biggest complaint is no other s-pen can be used with an offset issue  pen is too thin.battery is adequate but could be better plan on getting a full day out of it max in heavy use charge time is slow)no super amoled screen screen is very good  but not as good as amoled screens on other devices with less resolution.expect a long learning curve with information scattered all over the web.expensive  look for a refurbished or discounts to lower the price  otherwise wait for the new models to come outsamsungs customer support is not the best but is on par with everyone's lousy customer service these days.there is no perfect tablet on the market today the issues i raised are minor and overall i still think this is one of the best tablets you can buy today if you can find a discount on this tablet go for it you won't be disappointed i still think it is the best overall tablet you can buy at this time\n",
      "i'm not going to say too much about this tablet i love android and i really enjoyed the nexus 10 there is some lag here and there but nothing to really fuzz about i made a decision by taking this one over the ipad air/mini i choose the galaxy_note 10.1 why s pen android productivity freedom these are things i enjoy and i'm not saying this is the tab for everyone really know what you're buying before getting disappointed\n",

      "i considered a lot of variables before buying the samsung galaxy_note 10.1 2014 edition 32gb black)after weighing out cost processing speed operating system storage space and expandability i chose this product.it's screen size makes it easy to see and read the clarity of the screen is superb and the hi definition images are crisp and sharp i was hoping i could use one of my favorite programs on the tablet but unfortunately there isn't an app for it yet however there is a suitable substitute app that i am using and learning to like it is sketchbook pro learning it is not hard and getting used to the brushes has been fairly easy i am used to corel painter lite i love the mixing and blending abilities that this program has and i will always be watching for the release of an android based app for it.i would recommend this tablet to anyone considering and android based product\n",
      "up until recently i owned the galaxy_note 10.1 2012 edition and coming from that tablet to the 2014 edition i have to say that samsung has made a lot of improvements over last year's model.the device is very snappy even snappier out of the box than my original note 10.1 was tested it after wiping it just before selling it the display is a lot better than before as well battery life has me not needing to charge it as much even after streaming videos all day the previous model would last several hours but the battery would be in the red not the case on the 2014 model).the s-pen functions better than before especially with the air commands and multiple windows.i did not give it 5 stars because of a few quirks settings menu  it is in a tabbed view similar to the galaxy_s4 and it cannot be changed the note 3 has the same menu but it can be changed to a traditional list view).button placement  while i am used to the home button and capacitive menu and back buttons on my phone i was not used to them on this tablet i had to get used to them being in the same spot and not changing when switching the tablet from landscape to portrait the tablet design is the same as the galaxy_tab 3 line this is good to remember when ordering accessories as the cases for the tab 3 10.1 will fit the note 10.1 2014 so if you have one of those tablets then you should be ok with the button placement.overall the speed display s-pen functionality and battery life are a marked improvement over the 2012 model the software and button placement you will have to get used to beyond those quirks it is a quality tablet.finally as for the price it is higher than the previous model but i was paying 600 for the motorola xoom nearly 3 years ago so the price doesn't bother me really but for anyone wanting the 32gb model i would definitely take that into consideration before buying\n",
      "samsung galaxy_note 10.1 2014 edition 16gbsome background info for me i've been using android since 2010 so i have been accustomed to the os since froyo with my droid2 i finally switched to the galaxy_s3 in 2012 starting with ice cream sandwich i upgraded to 4.1.2 jelly bean late 2012 and just received the ota update to 4.3 a few weeks ago in early december 2013 because of this there wasn't much of a learning curve for me when using the galaxy_note 10.1 2014 edition i also have an ipad air the new one released in late 2013).the galaxy_note 10.1 2014 edition is model number sm-p600 running android 4.3 jelly bean out of the box according to antutu the cpu is a quad-core arm v7 vfpv4 neon at up to 1.9 ghz with a mali-t628 gpu running a screen resolution of 2560x1600 which is extraordinary given that the ipad air is 2048x1536 in my review of the ipad air i noted that no other tablets come close to this resolution other than the more expensive galaxy_note tablets that said i can't really discern the difference they are both very sharp displays.the sgn10.1 has a 8mp rear camera which is good but about on-par with most smartphones these days the front camera is 2.1 mp and is actually rated for 1920x1080 resolution hd the sgn10.1 has gps bluetooth g-sensor digital compass digital gyrometer/accelerometer.the gps works quite well for apps like google maps i did not have any problems with google now or voice recognition on the tablet.the interesting thing is that in the latest antutu benchmark my galaxy_note 10.1 scored 33746 which was just under the galaxy_note 3 in the rankings list which scored 34652 it looks like the biggest advantage of the galaxy_note 3 is faster ram the sgn10.1 has 3gb of ram and this model has 16gb of internal storage there is a micro sd slot for the ability to increase storage capacity android 4.3 is hokey with moving apps to the sd card apparently the 4.3 os views the sd card as a separate partition of the internal storage so none of the apps are actually moved to the sd card and continue to reside in the internal storage the camera app will detect the micro sd card and automatically store photographs and videos on the external sd card.the stylus is easy to use and works fine even with a screen protector i did not notice any delays that other people complained about the stylus isn't a simple capacitive stylus it is actually a pressure sensitive stylus with the same technology used in wacom tablets when the stylus tip approaches the screen you can see a cursor hovering over the screen it isn't a mandatory feature for most users but as a doodler and engineer i love this feature.the sgn10.1 has a really good on-screen keyboard even though it is the same android 4.3 as the galaxy_s3 and s4 i noticed that the keyboard in the sgn10.1 has the numbers on the top row which is the same as the s4 this saves a lot of time when entering passwords or when typing messages in general as before the google keyboard updates the key display to show shift modes and is much better than the static keyboard display in the ipad air.the build quality and construction of the sgn10.1 is in my honest opinion the weaker aspect of the sgn10.1 when compared with the ipad air the micro usb port is on the bottom of the tablet right under the home button on my galaxy_s3 this isn't a big deal but on the sgn10.1 most tri-fold cases prop the tablet up with the port facing the table surface preventing you from keeping it charged while watching a movie i have no complaints about the power or volume buttons and the home button looks and feels similar to the home button on my galaxy_s3.the speaker grill on the left seems kind of loose while the speaker grill on the right is solid and tight i normally don't complain about plastic housings because i feel the aluminum housing on the iphone and ipad is a bit excessive but the faux leather backing and the chromed plastic bezel on the sgn10.1 just feel really cheap to me if samsung had just kept a smoother plastic backing and a more matte silver bezel it would feel better imho this isn't a very big deal though especially when i use a moko case which covers up most of these surfaces the audio quality is not the best but it is good enough.many google apps are grouped together like gmail google now google plus samsung apps like knox and s-voice are also grouped together the first time i tried to find gmail it didn't show up in the apps list which confused the heck out of me also the main settings menu on the sgn10.1 are quite different from the galaxy_s4 which are also different from the galaxy_s3 i find it different not necessarily better or worse.pros same great android 4.3 interface as other devices galaxy_s3 s4 note 2 google apps are exceptional at this stage with google now being quite an intelligent piece of software screen resolution and cpu/gpu performance are top notch.cons battery life isn't the best but with all this power comes with a price i can easily see the battery level percentage dramatically drop within an hour of use the build quality and construction could be a lot better the ipad air still has the advantage in this department.overall 5/5 stars i'd still pick the galaxy_note 10.1 2014 edition over the ipad air i would recommend a screen protector and some kind of case for additional protection my amfilm anti-glare protector does not interfere with the stylus and the stylus marks come off with any type of mild cleaning solution\n",
      "i had wanted this tablet for some time...i considered it to be a top of the line product feels good in your hand very aesthetically pleasing with a nice finish samsung has loaded the galaxy_note with a truck load of excellent features including a split screen mode that allows you to run two apps side by side simultaneously an excellent remote control app and an amazing pen that facilitates any number of useful operations the rear camera takes exceptional photos the touchscreen produces brilliant images and the audio was way above average it was pretty much everything anyone could want in an android device and it really disturbed me to have to send it back but send it back i did the home button is an actual physical button you have to push while the back and widget buttons are digitized the problem is that it is virtually impossible to hold the tablet in landscape mode without constantly bumping those buttons there is literally no frame around the screen that you can hold without interfering with the operation of the tablet in the two days i tried it out i lost the page i was on or the app i was in because i could not find a safe way to hold the tablet...it was maddening\n",
      "my wife and i have had about eight ipads and currently own two needless to say we are apple fans recently the newer samsung galaxy_note 8 and the galaxy_note 10.1 caught our eye we actually traded/returned a new ipad air for the galaxy_note 8.i really like my new galaxy 10.1 but it does take a little time to get familiar with android systems just as it does if you switch back and forth between a mac and a windows pc.the galaxy_note 10.1 feels well made on about the same par as the ipads but i like the leather stiched back of the galaxy_as it feels nicer in my hands.the screen size is almost as big as the larger ipads and screen quality is fabulous i will keep my two ipads close but i will probably spend a lot of time on the galaxy now i have not had the galaxy long enough to know how it's battery will stack up against the ipad but the ipad is going to be very hard to match or exceed\n",
      "it is a very good device.but it did not meet my needs.compared to the newest ipad air as well as the kindle fire hdx 8.9 its obviously heavier in the hand it also really prefers a landscape orientation than a portrait orientation that is a problem and its reinforced by the placement of the typical samsung menu and back buttons along the lower bezel of the device the pen is great but its not as comfortable to hold and write on the screen with the weight and orientation limitations i had a specific goal in mind of using it for note taking and pdf annotation.sadly most android apps for pdf annotation are not that great--goodnotes for the ipad is vastly superior more reliable and faster.software issues aside the size weight and balance make note taking a little less than good for me perhaps a note 8.0 inch or even a galaxy_note 3 phone due to easier portrait orientation would be a better choice for pure note taking.the screen is amazing for video as the super amoled screen gives great blacks and the colors pop the micro-sd slot requires a lot of pressure to get the micro-sd card in--i had to use stylus--which i thought was odd perhaps my unit was defective so i did return it.you sort of also have to like touchwiz...which has its own pros and cons.its a good tablet but i think you have to hold it in your hand before you decide if it will work as technology improves i think its weight will be an issue\n",
      "i purchased a samsung galaxy_note 10.1 2014 edition black 16gb at best buy a few weeks ago i only used it for a few days before deciding to return it there's a lot of stupid problems here not all of which are samsung's fault but overall it's a no-deal for me.1 the simpsons game tapped out ran so slow as to be unusable the constant stuttering of the screen updates and the slowed-down animation made it obvious that somehow this particular game challenged the quad-core processor in the note it's a serious defect considering a two year old model like the asus tf300 could run the game 10 times faster and that unit is sluggish this might be a specific issue with this game and could be a software fix from ea but it's important to consider as the game it's very popular and widely used.2 the offers are good deals but they are limited to the device itself for example the free year of gogo inflight internet that's not something you can add to your existing account or even create a new account for instead everytime you want to use it you must connect to gogo from this tablet click on a chat now button and request from a csr a one-time code for that flight you'll need to repeat that process everytime you want to use it and it can't be used on a laptop or other device similar limitations exist for many but not all of the offers the 3 free audio books only 1 per month all of these offers are really just trial subscriptions with a few exceptions i strongly recommend checking out the details and fine-print here before buying 3 this note uses android 4.4 aka kitkat there is a major change in android 4.4 that affects how microsd card access works apps will no longer be able to access the entire card and read or write anywhere they want instead each app will have its own little closed-off area to use nothing else this means general-purpose file explorer apps will not be able to see anything on a microsd card photo viewers will be similarly limited backup programs will not be able to backup files from a microsd card though they will be able to backup file to the microsd card most significantly you will not be able to move apps to the mirosd to free-up space in the internal memory this is all being done by google not samsung but it still impacts this model i strongly recommend you read these articles before purchasing this device\n",
      "i love just about everything about the galaxy_note 10.1 2014 but the lag time in almost every app and function is very disappointing before i got it two months ago i read a great deal about the processor power that is built into it and i read reviews that said there is virtually no lag time compared to other tablets if that's true i don't know how anyone can stand to use those other tablets simply scrolling a website can be excruciating i swipe to scroll and there is often a full two-second lag before the screen scrolls i have no lag time on my galaxy_s3 running android 4.3 and i use most of the same apps on that so i don't think it's android or the apps.i've read complaints about the bluetooth not functioning but i've had no trouble with that i routinely use a bluetooth keyboard and mouse simultaneously with no issues the graphics are amazing and the look and feel of the tablet are perfect for me battery life is better than i thought it would be if only the processors functioned more smoothly i'd be thoroughly impressed with the galaxy_note 10.1 2014\n",
      "i own ipad asus transformer and galaxy_note 10.1 2014 edition bought not from amazon it is fast and has a beautiful display and the battery lasts 62 10 hours i bought note 10.1 for reasons 1 price 2 android software selection 3 more files/format support 4 the sound quality i really can not fault anything on this tablet the boot time is fast 64db sd card and great camera/pictures i just wish that it can be larger up to the laptop size say greater than 15 inch yes make it lighter and thinner so i can carry it anywhere if i have only one tablet to buy i will go for note for the return of my money ipad is too expensive and apple has too many restrictions on everything the built quality is also great the offer samsung is giving is also attractive\n",
      "waited to review this tablet just wanted to having some real world time using it 2 months as i said spent about two months with this galaxy_note 2014 and haven't been disappointed but i do have some nit picking for folks looking to purchase should be aware off first off my chief annoyance is with the internal gyroscope if you have a flip detachable keyboarded case that have magnetic backplate and strips there no way to use the drop down menu android users are accustom using as the gyroscope is extremely sensitive to anything magnetic and will lock the drop down menu until the tablet is removed from the case there's no way to turn this off or disable it plus i read overtime it can permanently damage the gyroscope so please take this into consideration when purchasing a flip case for this tablet next is this samsung my magazine app that built into the menu button when navigating the home screen using the menu button which should bring up the menu screen only to be redirected the my magazine app which i mind you cannot be turned off or disabled my last annoyance is with a great number of app that can't or won't allow for landscape mode or run on the tablet seeing as they were built for smartphones and the tablet option was an add on its the same os platform built android how in the heck an app works for one and not the other mind you this is a developer issue google controls the platform they need to encourage developers to cross build for the android both smartphone and tablet equally now that this is out of the way let's get back to the reason i bought the galaxy_note 2014 my computer motherboard was faulty and was in need of repair and if your like me everything is done on your computer so i toiled through online reviews to find a tablet to replace my computer if only temporary with maybe similar accessible features to get through day to day use and top specs hence the galaxy_note 2014 tab it uses firefox pulse news feed skype youtube and a host of other apps i use on my tiny 4.2 inch samsung nexus and places onto a 10.1 inch screen eliminating the constant eye strain and occasional tapping on in app ad's that have no barring to me whatsoever i use all these apps on my pc as well so this was a win-win-win for me the interface runs smooth with no hitches or hiccups all apps open within one second upon tapping on them and the setup is what you'd expect from an android device all the 10.1 screen real state does make a difference when using smartphone apps vs tablet apps this tablet has handled everything i through at it with relative easy and after a day of moderate use i still have just over a half battery charge left to work with if you're waiting on the new galaxy_note or tab pro 12.1 or 8.7 the galaxy_note 2014 has the exact same hardware specs pound for pound the only difference is the new tab pro run android 4.4 allowing 4 on screen open apps at once while the galaxy_note 2014 runs android 4.3 allow 2 open apps on screen at once if that a big deal too you kitkat 4.4 for the 2014 will be out sometime in april after the samsung galaxy 5 phone is released so unless you really need kitkat 4.4 immediately i'd say get the 2014 as all these 2014 samsung tablets are the same if you don't believe me checkout the other written and video reviews on the new samsung tab pro 12.1 with that said you can also root the 2014 to run a custom 4.4 unofficial kitkat rom with all the kitkat goodness all in all i'm very pleased with my purchase of the galaxy_note 2014 tablet\n",
      "i purchased two of the galaxy_note 10.1 2014 edition wi-fi only version on november 27 2013 one was for myself and one was for my fiancee we're both digital artists avid readers lovers of technology and were in need of a portable device with a screen larger than 5&#34;.having compared several tablets i was intrigued by this version of samsung's tablets based on a number of things  most notably familiarity with samsung products we both use galaxy_s4 phones the awesome specs and wacom-powered s-pen capabilities major website reviewers at the time were saying that based on price this tablet was gimmicky and an unnecessary purchase for those not in need of a stylus seeing the powerhouse specs of this device consistent performance in reviews and knowing the stylus was exactly what i wanted  i chose this one i'm glad i did.having read and watched several reviews online i knew what to expect with some of the odd physical design choices i've had several month to adapt to this tablet and by now i feel like it's absolutely worth putting that kind of time into adjusting to it's quirks i'll first run through the negative aspects the positive aspects and how we adjusted to said quirks.the quirks====================1 home keynegative the tablet seems to expect you to hold it in landscape mode horizontally as the physical home button is located bottom center which of course means that if you change the orientation to portrait mode vertical the button is generally right where your thumbs is going to land on either side this is further compounded by the fact that the settings and back capacitive buttons are to the left and right of the home button.at first i found this to be very very awkward i've read other reviewers who were so frustrated they returned theirs because they couldn't stand it indeed my fiancee went through the very same feelings as did i however i gave it some time and after a couple weeks of constant use i became quite comfortable with holding the unit and it's not even close to a problem i think of it now as a learning curve my fiancee solved her issues with the button by investing in a tablet cover that acts as a stand but also has a hand-strap at the back which helps her not to have to hold the unit by the sides.positive now that i'm accustomed to holding this tablet with the home key placement i use the tablet as effectively as any other device i own i rarely run into any 34;accidentals&#34 my fiancee doesn't use her tablet as often as i do and thus isn't as studious about holding hers a certain way thus she does get some 34;accidentals&#34 but she's getting used to it as the days go on.2 screen glarenegative there's a lot of it this is a high-gloss premium glass screen if you expect to have heavy lighting overhead especially fluorescent  you're going to spend a lot of time seeing the lights above you or looking at your own reflection at certain viewing angles the screen's brightness however is fantastic so moving it up to full will help some the best answer however is to just slightly change your viewing angle you can do this as your holding it or invest in a tablet cover that has a multiple angle stand once i was aware of the glare i worked around it and like the last issue was a minor learning curve.positive the glare may be a bit rough but the quality of the picture on the screen is beautiful online reviews say comparatively the screen is more washed out but i've not noticed watching movies gaming drawing using apps browsing the web all of it looks incredible because of this it really makes you want to adapt your usage to account for the screen glare just because the payoff is the gorgeous quality of the 10.1 realestate.3 charging slotnegative the micro usb charging slot is perhaps the most goofy senseless design element of all and one i still find myself wishing was different it's directly under the physical home key on the bottom edge of the device holding this while charging becomes an interesting juggle with that cord jutting out terribly uncomfortable experience while laying on your back in bed while charging or even while sitting up to play a game add to this the fact that some games force horizontal orientation and you're going to expect to be irritated when your battery needs a charge while i haven't found any great solutions to this it isn't so bad if you're holding it in portrait mode as an aside if you're not paying attention in dim lighting it's easy to try to shove your charging cord into the ir blaster on the exact opposite end the blasters even in the same shape as the charging slot but thankfully it does no harm apart from making you feel like an idiot that you weren't paying attention.positve there isn't anything positive to say about the design placement sadly but the slot works well the tablet charges albeit slowly up just like any device the charger is the same as any other early 2014 samsung device so you can use your s4 charger to charge the tablet and lastly my fiancee who is not a power-user hasn't mentioned this as an issue at all.====================those quirks sound intense but remember i'm giving you a very detailed account of my personal thoughts and experiences and there are a lot of reasons to look past them we're going to get to those now i'll take the same format as the above where applicable for the good things though i'll begin each with a short description on why i like these features.1 s-pen  stylusi use wacom technology every day to create art for both business and personal art wacom is my go-to for all things stylus and that they paired with samsung to give you an authentic high-quality stylus experience is just phenomenal i both need to take notes and be able to draw on the fly so this is my second main reason for purchasing this device.negative the stylus is rather short and very very light as a man with large hands it's kind of strange to hold something so dainty the button on the stylus to call up the air-view features is all-too-easy to press while using it however this is also a problem with full-size wacom tablets where the samsung s-pen fails is that this stylus is rectangular so there's no option to simply roll the buttons away from your fingers as you can with a normal wacom art stylus.suggestions i've read you can simply get a metal pencil holder to extend the length of the stylus  though i haven't tried this yet i've also read that the new note pro 12.2 has a redesigned stylus  though i haven't looked into compatibility and shape yet.postive the stylus works great there's no leading or drag it glides smoothly over the screen the cursor on screen which can be toggled off an on is pin-point accurate at virtually every angle and regardless of the above it gets the job done with seemingly no effort that the stylus is conveniently stored in the upper right corner landscape of the device is awesome it's easy to access and easy to put away it snaps in firmly and i never worry about it falling out the air-view features are mostly very useful and worth leaving on see a different review for more on air-view.performancethis is the first deciding factor for me i needed a tablet that was going to perform lag-free partially for preference but also for performing art you can't draw effectively if your machine is lagging and i wouldn't have the patience for it but on paper at least it looks fantastic.negative none.positive the paper was right i glow with confidence everytime i pick this tablet up because i know it's going to be a champ i've never once encountered stuttering or lag of any kind no matter how much i run on this thing i've pushed it with multi-window overblowing apps in the background while running a heavy one in the foreground and i've gamed to death with high-resource graphics-intensive games it's been 5months with this tablet by now and no issues whatsoever it's always buttery smooth any issues i've run into have been poor internet connection on my end or software glitches in the app i was using i do give my tablet an intentional restart every couple of weeks i don't know that i need to but it hasn't hurt.screen sizehaving never owned a tablet before i wasn't sure if 10 inches of screen would be too large or too small i took the gamble if only based on all the other items on my list of 34;must haves&#34;.negative it takes getting used to if you've never held something this large before this was a double issue for my fiancee who has smaller hands for her she finds she loves the screen size for some things reading and shopping especially but prefers the smaller screen of her phone for others much of this has to do with typing  which i might add i agree with her coupled with adjusting to holding it typing is rather laborious you end up moving your whole hand rather than just your fingers however the default samsung keyboard and swype both have options to shrink the keyboard more phone sized and split the keyboard to type thumbs only for me these actually give quite a bit of typing relief.alternately you could invest in a compatible bluetooth keyboard i purchased a tablet cover which came with one and it was easy to set up easy to reconnect and felt very close to a laptop typing experience.positive 10 inches of screens has turned out to be the perfect number for me it's generous for web browsing a huge blessing for games excellent for business and personal notes and office documents and spot on for drawing it was only just big enough to enjoy watching tv shows but due to my want for a full cinema experience i would probably not watch a movie on this for those who enjoy watching movies on their mobile device  you'll love it if my picky attitude can enjoy a tv show on here you'll probably scoff at me and revel.on art for my first art experiences with this tablet i took it with me on a week long cruise and was happy i did i didn't have to bring the entire backpack of my art supplies i was accustomed  just this one lone very convenient tablet i completed four impressive works and short of a wacom/windows hybrid tablet it proved to be nearly everything i need for mobile art needs lack of needed software prevents me from performing my business art on this device but for conceptual work and personal art this is a killer device.for business as i understand it this device can be hooked up to projectors old and new and used functionally for lectures and the like while i haven't personally tested this i've read a great many reviews from business people explaining how they have and that it was great for it.featuresthis tablet actually has a crap-load of features not many of them feel like bloat either your usual samsung line of course but also autodesk sketchbook evernote and action memo to name a few the air-view features are also 98 useful for screenshot note taking and editing i'm going to skip the positive/negative on this one because there's still several features i haven't used such as handwriting-to-text translation however my overall experience with every feature and setting in this app has been wonderful.your normal slew of samsung's latest line of misc features is here air-gesture smart stay smart pause smart-scroll multi-window screen mirroring power saving mode etc etc so many in fact that it may take awhile to remember all of your settings i'm 5 months in and i'm still finding new things about optimizing my experience.although it won't ever replace my tried and true tv remote  the ir blaster is cool and screen sharing with my smart tv makes for a fun experience.this is an optimum device for chromecasting thanks to the screensize making the ui so easy to access i much prefer it for this than my phone.tip make sure you software update your tablet as soon as you get it i did right out of the box and i had nearly 5 updates waiting for me it's now on auto-update for those and i'm anxiously anticipating kit-kat to give even better performance.sound qualityoverall with the external speakers it's just okay speakers are in the back and often get covered up when using a cover i often have to move the flipped cover away from the back to better hear audio this is improved when the covers is used as a stand as the sound bounces back but like any mobile device the speakers aren't as ace as just using headphones.headphone experience is killer samsung's integrated software for improving headphone sound is magnificent music and other media sounds superior even with just your included samsung ear-buds i highly recommend getting your audio this way  however it's not a complete fail on using the external speakers.battery lifeoverall battery life is one of those things every mobile device struggles with i'm a pretty heavy tablet user and in just a few hours of drawing gaming and movie watching i'll have the battery down to about 30 i can assume about and extra hour or so past that depending on what i'm using but it's just as easy to plug it in and power use which has become my usage habit when home.my fiancee who i'd deem a moderate tablet user gleans a full-day out of hers before deciding it needs a charge on standby alone it will last around a day and half considering the size and quality of this screen and that it's fairly light for it's size i really think this is good battery life power users like myself may want to look into an external battery extender as this battery cannot be removed.durabilityoverall with its size weight squarish shape and glass screen this is an accident waiting to happen don't misunderstand it feels very durable to hold but like all mobile devices these days the ever present fear of dropping is most certainly here in this tablet i definitely recommend a case for drop protection  even at home keep in mind that the front is all glass and while the back does offer some grip for your hands its back will slide across a tablet or nightstand faster than a hockey puck give the opportunity.there are a lot of great cases out there for this device my fiancee and i both prefer different cases for different reasons i'm using the official samsung book cover because it's slim protects the corners offers multiple angle stand and is very light she prefers a case with a hand-strap on the back to assist in holding with a multiple angle stand-cover and business card/pen holder we both also have alternate cases with bluetooth keyboards for travel  though we rarely use them.have questions don't be bashful to ask\n",
      "my wife is loving the samsung galaxy_note 10.1 2014 it is big enough for her older eyes to read things and yet small enough to hold in her hands without being heavy like a laptop computer it is faster than our older laptop and fun to use we have not tried to create a document or spread sheet with it so far all we have done is browse the internet and check e-mails we are just learning how to use the pen we own a samsung smart-phone and were able to transfer all of the apps off of it to the note 10.1 so we did not have to re-install of of them we had a minor problem with it the first day  it was not easy to get it to communicate with our wi-fi it took several hours to figure that out\n",
      "samsung's latest stylus-equipped tablet galaxy_note 10.1 2014 which came out in october 2013 was met with disappointing sales that many believed to be due to the increasing popularity of mini 7 to 8 tablets but the fact is the note 10.1 2014 is the best tablet yet from samsung with advanced specs and a state-of-the-art stylus that make this device a worthy competitor to apple's ipad air.the biggest selling point of the note 10.1 2014 is its advanced stylus called s pen which should benefit those who handwrite and draw a lot the 10.1-inch touch-screen doubles as a wacom digitizer board that senses pen pressure and displays pen stroke thickness accordingly the s pen also talks to the note tablet if you hold the tip of the s pen close to the screen the note will sense its presence and automatically disables the touch-screen so your hands won't accidentally touch it while you are writing or drawing.the s pen has a fine-point tip that allows precise interaction with the screen the tip is replaceable if it gets dull over time search amazon for s pen nib the tip is short and thin but the end of the tip is round not sharp the note tablet has a pen holder at the corner for docking your s pen so you won't lose it so easily.samsung doesn't offer a comparable pen-less version of the note 10.1 2014 the other 10 tablets from samsung galaxy_tab 10.1 and nexus 10 both have less advanced specs compared to the note 10.1 2014 wait for the rumored upcoming release of nexus 10 2013 edition which may have better specs such as the latest android os 4.4 if you want just a vanilla 10 tablet or if you prefer ios get an ipad air.s pen is obviously for those who draw and/or write notes a lot but if your notes consist mainly of text and you mainly type your notes then probably any tablet or device will do if you need handwriting recognition for text there are already apps with such ability made for regular tablets so you don't necessarily need the s pen rather the note and its s pen are best for people who have to handwrite and draw they are for those whose note-taking involves a mixture of words symbols and drawings or any type of activity that necessitates handwriting or drawing.for instance the s pen would be useful for students who take notes in class professionals who make quick visual notes or anyone who needs to jot down any info that isn't only text useful scenarios for the s pen include designers who need make some quick drawings mathematicians writing down equations writers of east asian languages who may find it more convenient to handwrite than using complex input methods or anyone who needs to make a lot of handwritten annotations on pictures documents etc.the s pen's handwriting recognition for text is supported system-wide wherever the regular keyboard pops up once you take out the s pen from its holder the note immediately changes the keyboard to a writing pad that recognizes your writing this only works if you specify the default samsung keyboard in system settings if you install and use third-party keyboard apps this will not work.the s pen's handwriting recognition for shapes however is supported only in a few apps by shape recognition i mean the note will turn your rough drawing of a square circle or any recognizable shape into a perfectly drawn shape this results in neater and more presentable notes.three bundled apps are able to recognize hand-drawn shapes polaris office 5 is able to recognize simple 2-dimensional shapes only squares triangles stars etc s finder is able to search for symbols you have written in your notes but sadly this only works for 5 symbols star circle heart question mark and smiley face s note is a powerful app that links to your evernote or samsung account it recognizes 2-dimensional and cubic shapes more accurately and also lets you edit them more easily.s note is a richly featured app that recognizes handwritten text of all languages shapes and mathematical formulas it lets you tranform and undo transforming handwritten words to real text that can be copied and pasted elsewhere it lets you transform and undo transforming handwritten mathematical formulas into png image of properly-typefaced formulas it lets you resize any part of your note when you run out of room on a page you can change colors of any object you can even adjust the thickness of the pen strokes already written you can use the eraser to erase any portion of your note down to individual pen strokes you can also choose different pen styles ball-point pen pencil caligraphy brush hi-lighter you can customize pen color thickness and even set pen presets and of course there is s pen's ability to sense pen pressure and draw thickness accordingly every action is undoable or redoable most importantly the plethora of features work really well.needless to say samsung did a great job with s note which really shows off the s pen's capability beautifully this will probably be the most used app for many who buy the note 10.1 2014 as i said all notes are linked to your evernote account if you use the evernote app to view or edit your s note creations you will be taken automatically to the s note app.but the excellent s note lacks one good feature that only action memo has action memo is another bundled app for note-taking but it is a much more primitive compared to s note while it recognizes handwriting it does not transform handwriting stays as is it lacks many advanced editing features found in s note as well but action memo has the unique ability to perform actions on your handwriting such as adding your handwritten name and phone number to your contacts sending an email address directly to a new email composition sending an address to the map app or sending a search word to a browser's search field of course you could just open up the individual contacts email map and browser app and make your entry there hence this feature's usefulness is somewhat suspect other than this lone capability of action memo i think most of you would use s note most often instead.the s pen costs thirty dollars should you need to replace it make sure you get the one specifically for the note 10.1 2014 tablet so it will fit into the pen holder do not buy the one for the note smartphones nor the one for last year's note 10.1 samsung's website shows that only the black s pen is available part et-pp600sbeguj hence owners of the white edition of note 10.1 2014 need to make sure they don't lose their white s pen.the s pen itself has a button that launches the air command menu which lets you launch any of 5 apps action memo scrapbooker screen write s finder and pen window sadly s note is not among them and the air command menu is not customizable.scrapbooker lets you free-hand lasso any image on the screen and save it to the scrapbook app this is essentially just a screen-capturing function that also lets you cut out only the part you want.\"screen write lets you capture a screen and write on the image afterwards the bonus in doing so is that words written in this manner are searchable by s finder provided that your writing is legible enough for recognition and that the words are written on solid backgrounds with color that contrasts nicely with font colors so that recognition is more likely.you can screen-capture the traditional way by pressing the home and power button simultaneously captures are saved in the gallery app where you can add writings to the pictures but writings made in this manner are not searchable by s finder apparently words are not indexed here thus making them not searchable.s finder is the global search function of the note 10.1 it searches contacts visited webpages note content help content handwriting created in s note action memo and screen write and online content via google as well as i mentioned it also searches for five symbols star circle heart question mark and smiley face you are supposed to use these symbols to tag your items allowing them to be searched more easily but as i said 5 symbols are just too limited to be useful for such a purpose.\"pen window is a multi-tasking multi-window feature it opens up a small window lets you choose another app which must be one of the built-in apps such as calculator browser etc which will then open up in a smaller window on top of your current app.more useful is the actual multi-window feature which works like this you open up a tab on the left of the screen choose an app which must also be one of the built-in apps and it will run side by side with your current app you can share info between the two apps by dragging and dropping if both apps allow it this is useful when for instance you are composing a document in polaris office and you need to drag a picture from the gallery app to the document.the note 10.1 2014 has voice recognition as well whenever the samsung keyboard or writing pad appear there is a button for voice command which functions for any language you select it works pretty well also technology has advanced to the point where voice recognition works pretty well for everyday vocabulary of course you may not want to do this in a crowded environment where other people can hear everything word you enter you may want to turn off the keyboard tapping sound as well which also helps to conserve power.regarding battery power the note 10.1 2014 has a few features that drain power and may even overheat the cpu i installed the third-party app android tuner to monitor the cpu's temperature one day i was shocked to see that it went up to 70-80c which is too hot even for desktop cpus i turned off the note's palm gestures and smart screen features and the temperature went right back to a normal 30-40c palm gestures let you take screen captures or pause video playback by moving your palm in specific ways and they don't always work smart screen is supposed to let you motion your eyes to perform certain basic tasks but again it doesn't work reliably better to turn these features off to save battery and the cpu.---comparison with ipad airchoosing between a samsung tablet and an ipad may come down to whether you are a bigger fan of android or ios in terms of apps both operating systems offer many of the same apps in their respective ecosystem there are some notable differences in os features however.android lets you enhance the home screen with widgets such as stock market ticker weather tracker news headlines listing etc both android and ios let you install third-party apps to enhance your home screen appearance.both android and ios let you install third-party keyboard apps ios comes with east asian keyboards with handwriting recognition android doesn't so you need to get third-party apps for that.many android devices come with a microsd card slot so you can add extra storage with ios devices the only way you can get extra storage is to pay a hundred dollar more to get the model with more storage.the micro-usb port on many android devices can connect to external usb hard drive with the necessary cable the micro-usb port on ios devices cannot connect to anything other than ios accessories.former ios users who are new to android may be disappointed that android doesn't have the ability to let you tap on the top of the screen to return you to the top of the page you have finger-scroll all the way up.also android does not have audio notification for sent email the way the ios email app does the swoosh sound).here are some comparisons specific to the galaxy_note 10.1 2014 and ipad air:in terms of looks the note 10.1 2014 has a shiny silvery outer edge that makes the device look quite cheap and a faux leather back cover that looks even cheaper ipad air has a sleek clean look and an aluminum body that is beautiful to the eyes and great to the touch as well both devices are the lightest 10 tablets available weighing slightly over a pound each.a blessing for some but an annoyance for others the screen of the note 10.1 2014 is wider and shorter than ipad air's due to its 16:10 aspect ratio as is the case for many android tablets while all ipads are in 4:3 aspect ratio a wider 16:10 screen benefits those who watch movies and tv shows since most of today's shows are shot in wide-screen a 4:3 screen is better for photographs and reading since 4:3 is the common aspect ratio for photography and a printed page typically letter size 8.5 by 11 is also close to 4:3.both the note 10.1 2014 and ipad air display in very high resolutions that exceed 1080p hd resolution 2560x1600 for the note and 2048x1536 for ipad air they enable the shooting and viewing of high-quality and detailed videos and photos.the note 10.1 2014 supports the latest wi-fi 802.11 ac protocol in addition to a/b/g/n protocols while the ipad air only supports a/b/g/n ac supports greater frequency range and data rates but routers that support ac are currently more expensive.the note comes with 8mp rear and 2mp front cameras both allow you to shoot videos at 1080p or lower at 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratio you can shoot stills in 16:9 or 4:3 ratio as well the rear camera also has led flash the camera app also lets you set a timer in comparison ipad air has 5mp rear and 1.2mp front cameras the rear camera only shoot videos at a fixed 1080p 16:9 format and the front front camera at a fixed 720p 16:9 format both cameras only shoot stills in 4:3 format there is also no led flash nor timer.some ios devices do have led flash like iphone and ipod touch in ios 7 the led flash doubles as a flashlight as well note's led flash is just a flash.the speakers on the note is noticeably louder than the ipad air's but you need to adjust the audio with an equalizer app to get better sound quality with headphones on both devices have similar audio quality.the note has two speakers on the left and eight sides both pointing away from you instead of towards you you may need to cup your hands around the speakers to redirect the sound towards you sort of like cupping your hands around your ears to listen better\n",
      "i just picked one of these up and am jotting down some very initial observations what strikes me is how this appears to be a really massive upgrade from the last 10.1 which i owned for any of you 10.1 2012 owners out there who are wondering about it go to any best buy as they all have them i didn't take to the first 10.1 particularly it was ok but i used the galaxy_note 8 for notes instead this thing is something else looks wise but there might be some lag i haven't noticed so don't hold me to any of this the reviewers lamented about this but i don't really care even if there is some lag at some places as i take the it's always something attitude just a heads up  update well after only a single day i may be returning it i said the build quality is improved but it hasn't it's not that great maybe even not as good as the previous 10.1 i can hear a bit of creaking when i pick it up now the galaxy_note 8 i have doesn't do that probably as the stress is less it weighing in at about half i will try it for a week and see if i warm to it as i need the notebook part of this i don't use these for anything but that and considering the cost of this i had better like it a lot  \n",
      "hello all techys when going with a tablet i wana go with one that wont be out classed or speced in the next years model well no worrys if you get the galaxy_note 10.1 2014 let me explain why the pixel density of 299 ppi and a resolution of 2560 x 1600 speakers on the side instead of the bottom so no worries about them sounding muffled and yes a sd slot that you can add an extra 64 gb of space that kept me from buying the nexus tablets that everyone raves about no sd slot plus this thing is fast 1.9ghz quad core processor and 3gb's of ram get this tablet if you dont want to worry about having tp get something better every year\n",

      "i am a tablet geek so i had to have this one i ended up sending one back and getting the 32gb model the bloat ware they install is a waste of space some you can remove some no the graphics are really great and that was not a big deal for me but i can see the difference on it it really does have great screen watching moviesthe s pen is my favorite feature and i still have not learned all that it can do but i learn something new every day i love to draw with the s pen it is more precise some drawing apps  sketchbook for galaxy_note pre installed are designed with special versions to use with the s pen it does not support flash the most recent version but i understand it can be downloaded from the flash archives older versions i will do that soon over all once i upgraded to more memory i was very happy with the tablet it lags at times certain apps but i can live with it i am sure future updates will fix that with my ipad 2 and my asus transformer i often wished i old have apps opened side by side now with this i can and do the battery seems to run down a bit faster but with the power saver and a little experience i have learned what to turn off and on to save battery life most devices use battery power like mad it is a little pricey and that made the decision to purchase this a little harder same with ipad 2 but i have no regrets at all one more thing for now is that you can't watch amazon prime videos on it the amazon prime movie app is not compatible that was disappointing because all my movie and tv entertainment is online cable has became obsolete for me i will update as i feel it should be will give 5 stars when they fix the minor lag problem\n",

      "i have been a big fan of galaxy_tablet series and i have been trying out the new samsung galaxy_note 10.1 edition the resolution is just amazing at a 2560x1600 the resolution is the single biggest improvement over previous generation which was just 1280x800 i was blown away with the resolution.compared to previous model size has reduced a bit weight decreased a bit and memory of 3gb is so good battery has bumped up to 8220 mah there is no other tablet on the market with such an integrated s pen system and for this alone this is a terrific buy if you are someone who has to take notes on a frequent basis the 10.1 2014 edition is a great buy if you browse tv shows you tube videos on a regular basis this is again awesome if you are not into lot of note taking you should not consider this this model's cousin the tab 3 series is apt for regular use again i did not use the last generation for its low resolution this model trumps it all my only wish is the weight and price could have been even lower at 1.26 lbs it is not the lowest in the market with ipad air at only 1 lbs it is sure to have competition but i am a fan of android and the use of back button and i like the samsung series for that reason.64 gb sd card is awesome with prices plummeting for 64 gb cards it is a great boon put all your music books photos on the sd card and you have a powerful computer in hand always i personally use the 64 gb microsd card on my mobile devices get this mobileultra sandisk 64gb mobile ultra microsdxc class 6 memory card with sd adapter  retail packaging.i tested otg capability and it is great to have a external usb support usb host is one of the most undernoticed features of androids and is in my opinion one of the best features compared to ipad lines what this means you get a usb host cable also otherwise called otg on the go cables and plug in your usb thumb drive or other usb devices and the device recognizes it i have used it with alfa awus036h for a wireless project with android pcap capture from reputable kismet wireless another much ignored feature is the tv-out via mhl a/v link unfortunately the 7 does not support it whereas 8in and 10.1 in supports it you can connect galaxy_devices to a tv to make it truly a fantastic computer if the device supports mhl throw in a bluetooth keyboard and it is awesome leo laporte's twit tv which is internet based show has one full episode in know how on covering this topic gps was spot on and i tried multiple gps apps it was bright outdoors had to crank the brightness all the way up i personally use navigon from garmin and have downloaded several apps.i tried following apps and they just worked awesome a tablet is only as good as the apps you have and how productive it makes you it's almost like the camera/lens analogy in the dslr space what good it is to have a great dslr body if you have no good lens same with tablet body and apps you have.wolframalpha i can go on for hours praising this this is a truly genius app powered by hundreds of supercomputers in the background wolfram is a computational genius well worth the 3 price.withings healthmate another remarkable app great ui/ux i am getting the pulse device as soon as it hit stores i have been using fitbit and just itching to get the pulse as i like the intergrated weight/track runs in one app)aldiko book reader premium absolutely love it)amazon mobileandroid statusandroid central app great and must have for android users)androidifyangry birds space/seasons)asphalt 7amazon app storebattery monitor widget pro a great app)beyondpod excellent for podcasts i haven't used pocketcast some friends say it is very good too)boxcar maintenance reminder prochromecloudshark uploadcnet tvdespicable me game and weather widget cute for kids)dictionary m-w premiumdragonvalenavigon from garmin  offline maps)google navigation/earth/maps using a portable mifi boxgoogle currents nice way to read news)google keep/keboard/drive/search/books/voice/hangoutsdraw somethingebaylinkedingoogle music awesome i have now upto 10,000 songs halfway through google's 20k limit)tapatalk hd awesome forum browsing app)overdrive media console library ebooks  audiobooksmicrosoft one note legacy docs skydrive of 25 gb is good)subsonic music streamerterminal emulator still need to use vi yes this is it)tweetcaster pro for androidtwit.tvskypesphero awesome bluetooth ball game)realcalc plus awesome calculator app)tweetcaster pro again awesomeness)plenty of widgetsask questions the reviews cannot do full justice i will be glad to answer any questions and usually answer within 24 hours to any query\n",
      "quite frankly my galaxy_note ii phone is faster more responsive and easier to use i opted to go with the note 10.1 2014 device over the other offerings from apple and kindle because of my familiarity of android and the note this tablet is heavier than it should be slower than it's advertised and the screen display isn't eye popping off the screen it's purported to be at least through my 20/20 vision and experience in short it's clunky.the s pen features are okay but hardly user friendly saving a picture through a screen save is easy enough but then writing on the picture with the s pen not the same as the galaxy_note ii so ease of use on the tablet is for me not the same and not user friendly it seems to me that this tablet was created by a committee with every voice getting their oar in the water for the finished product which is a bit of a mess\n",
      "excellent device i have used it for a month and have very few qualms about it i have been using the ipad since it's introduction and wanted to change it up i have bought a few android tablets and returned them within a couple of days because of various performance issues well i took the plunge and bought this mainly because of my experience with the regular phone galaxy_note and wanted to see how it would work out on a bigger screen needless to say i'm staying with it.pros:lightweightusb chargerexpandable storagefeature setspeakerscons:battery lifestutters at timehardware button placementtouchwizi took some adjustments and some sacrifices as i absolutely find itunes to be a savior since i travel overseas constantly but i have researched and found ways around it samsung products are not of the best build quality but they pack it full of features to help touchwiz the ui layover android 4.3 makes the tablet lag and take up so much space before you even load up anything however it is a well rounded device and the arguably the best android tablet out there the only reason i don't think it is the best tablet is not samsung's fault but google play doesn't have as many tablet optimized apps as itunes but maybe it will get there\n",
      "before i write anything i wanted to comment about reviews people leave on a device os vs the device itself.it appears that for anyone dropping 600 on a tablet who has not had the experience of android or at least tried it out beforehand should be committed to a prison for the ignorant.there are a lot of android tablets and i am going to review this unit vs the ipad 3 that we have here in the house i have an ipad 2 for work but wife has the ipad 3 so better comparison.i've owned the following tablets:lenovo android 1st gensamsung galaxy_tab 1st genmotorola xoomnexus 7apple ipad 2 and 3amazon kindle fire 1st genwe as a company changed over to google apps 4 years ago and i find it an excellent platform that surpasses anything microsoft puts out in total cross functional with microsoft apps as they have refined the software and works very well for business users unless you need a heavy graphics type software.that being said this tablet is by far the best tablet i've used in the short period of time that i have been testing it.i take a lot of notes in business meetings and i am also a heavy evernote user/google drive user.this tablet integrates beautifully with evernote the s note feature alone makes this tablet a winner for those that prefer to write notes during meetings and not look like a fool banging away on an ipad screen which can really be distracting especially if you have one on one meetings with a client.the pen itself is extremely comfortable to handle it writes smoothly and if you choose converting to text is very accurate and i really do have chicken scratch like handwriting that said it's not flawless but pretty damned close.the hardware is excellent it's buttery smooth when moving from screen to screen and app to app not sure how others complain of lag but then again i've only had it for 7 days so maybe it bogs down over time thus far that's not been the case.it's very light...can easily hold in one hand although it's not designed or meant to be used that way.i used quickoffice pro hd polaris that it comes with as well as google drive for all my word processing ppt and excel needs all of these will work just fine for the average business user.the colors on the device are far superior to my ipads 2 and 3...i read somewhere that someone felt the colors were muted or not that bright but i suspect the user had the brightness turned way down because this just blows away my ipads my wife a long time apple loyalist agrees with me that this tablet is brighter and just looks better when looking at movies internet videos etc.we looked at pictures the exact same pictures on both the ipad and galaxy_note 10.1 and no question that while the ipad does look great this tablet is just better overall we looked at them over and over and while to the average user you might not care or notice i did.now i too am invested in the apple ecosystem...we have an apple tv and a lot of movies and music purchased that we access.i also have company issued ipad i use the apple tv and airplay to do wireless presentations and it works great.however i always laugh when apple tries to tout their app store as so much far superior in content than android yeah if you need a lot of fart apps and apps that don't really mean a whole lot to the average user than sure but overall all the major apps companies that have apps have one for both apple and android at this point so that's just a stupid useless comparison based solely on numbers.the experience of using this note vs apple is where there is the major difference the note for me just feels better when using it i feel like i'm using a professional device for a true professional i can see where with students this would be even better with the variety of note taking capability that the s-pen offers.s-note action memo scrap booking features are just excellent for anyone that needs to take notes and the autodesk sketchbook app is fantastic although i will probably use it less than others because i'm not an artist my daughter used it and drew beautiful pictures and now she's constantly asking for me to use it.another feature i like is the watchon app that came with it i control by tv and directv receiver with it but the content it offers is excellent...tracking my favorite programs and easily recording or even watching them if the service is available is a snap.i watched for about 30 minutes prometheus on this and it was flawless.apple is a great product...no question but really at the end of the day it's more an entertainment device than that for a serious professional i'm sure you can try like i did with the keyboards and various apps to make it a professional device and it can be customized if you'd like especially if you're 100 invested in the apple ecosystem but i didn't want to be married to one.i have the galaxy_note 3 for my phone as well so i have both android for work and apple for play.if you are a professional who finds they need a tablet for note taking multi tasking or a student that needs notes for classes or artistry this is the tablet for you if you want a tablet to just watch movies and videos or listen strictly to music and play games on i'd recommend the ipad.this 10.1 2014 edition is sleek fast multi functional has the min sd card slot as well for that extra storage can handle all the movies i through at it and looks fantastic..feels great in the hand much lighter than any android tablet i've had in the past except maybe the nexus 7...i'll be testing it over the next 3 weeks to make sure it still performs as it should..but for now very little to complain about.pros:lightfast processorpen ability far superior to othersresponsiveprofessional look and build qualitybuilt in speakers are loud and clear..better than many tablets on marketcolors are beautifulboot time less than 30 seconds.cons:expensivewish pen had an alert like note 3 to let you know if you left it outpen feels almost too light doesn't affect performance)not a whole lot of accessories for it.edit upgrade to 5 stars why?battery life is outstanding i'm getting well over a full day of really heavy use that's constant email note taking browsing pandora and podcasts running in background i don't do video games so cannot comment on that but for heavy business use i'm unplugging at 530am,reading wsj and ny times watching video highlights on espn checking emails for hours typing emails and taking notes during calls my screen is on more than half the time and by time i plug in at 11pm i'm still at 25 battery left.i also watched movie for 2 hours on flight and under same circumstances still had 15 left.brightness is at about 50 and wifi constantly on fantastic battery life.update  big updatewell i'm frustrated now after having this for a couple months.what's happening for whatever reason i need to reboot the tablet every single day i can feel it get very hot in back and then the clock stops working and it starts to lag.i did a full factory reset and that worked..for 2 days...and it started all over again and i did not have apps reinstalled on it so it's not an app issue.i don't know what is happening but this has become so frustrating now.everything else i stand by but how the hell can you give this a high rating when this continues to happen with no fix\n",
      "i really was not planning on making this purchase as i already own a samsung galaxy_note 10.1 which i like a lot but being tempted by the specifications of this 2014 edition beautiful screen speed size etc and also taking into consideration that my older daughter was encouraging me to make the purchase so she could get her hands on my note 10.1 i finally decided to do the deed.the one thing that i was worried about was the placement of the speakers i liked the speakers facing forward on the older model which is a rear feature on tablets but after playing the same videos and music on both side by side i was pleasantly surprised that the note 10.1 2014 edition's side firing speakers were actually louder clearer and has better stereo separation than the front facing speakers of the previous model.another plus was the fact that i can now print directly from my note 10.1 2014 edition using my hp printer gone are the days of having to also purchase a samsung printer just to print from your tablet this is a great move by samsung.this tablet is a great performer the only two little negatives that i can think about is the fact that:(1 i don't know if it's my mind playing tricks on me but it seems to me that the 2014 edition's battery drains a little faster than the model before it i think i'll do a little test by fully charging both then playing the same movie on both with brightness set to half and i'll post the results for those who are interested.(2 i've also noticed a very little light-bleed particularly at the bottom of the screen while watching a movie with the black band at top and bottom this is in no way a deal breaker as you will hardly ever notice this.update 18/12/2013:after going a little deeper with my comparison between mysamsung galaxy_note 10.1 16gb white)andsamsung galaxy_note 10.1 2014 edition 32gb white i've come to a few conclusions.test 1:i streamed the movie olympus has fallen from netflix with both tablets playing at the same time in sync i started with both tablets at 100 battery charge 50 brightness and 50 volume level and at the end of the movie credits thesamsung galaxy_note 10.1 16gb white)was at 64 battery life while thesamsung galaxy_note 10.1 2014 edition 32gb white)was at 57 battery life a 7 difference by the way when looking at the same picture movie etc on both tablets side by side the older tablet has a noticeably bluish hue as opposed to the newer model which shows more vibrant natural colors.test 2:i continued using both tablets until they reached the 50 battery level then i started the charging process while timing on a stopwatch thesamsung galaxy_note 10.1 16gb white)took 2:40 to charge from 50 while thesamsung galaxy_note 10.1 2014 edition 32gb white)took 3:13 to charge from 50 a 33 minute difference.all in all i love this tablet the resolution of this screen is something to behold everything looks so much better and words are much clearer and i'm really impressed with the sound quality and processor speed i'm happy that i made the purchase can't wait to see what samsung comes up with next in the note 10.1 line hope this helps a little.pros realistic color screen is bright and beautiful great sounding speakers can print with my hp printer via wifi.cons little light bleed around edges but nothing to talk about\n",
      "i purchased this when i'd had enough of the low ram in my ipad3 i was running into issues with ios7 where the ipad would lag with too many apps open and only 3 web browser tabs could be active at any given time without them having to reload when you clicked back over to the tab.the first galaxy_note was doa got audio but the screen did not work i tried everything and finally had amazon replace it which they did quickly the second one worked fine.packaging:the device was packaged well included were the galaxy_note tablet the pen ac adapter and usb charging cable and a small users guide package i never opened.setup:once i got a working device setup was easy pretty much the standard android fair configure it for your wireless put in your google account info and you are pretty much good to go.pros the screen is great high resolution rich colors and good contrast the samsung skinned version of android 4.3 has some great features like split window with multiple apps running on the screen simultaneously the pen and built-in wacom digitizer are a great combination if you are an artist games shine with the high end hardware on this device charges with standard mini-usb connector pen could be good for taking notes if you get a good notes app the samsung included version is not good)cons not a fan of the fake plastic leather backing samsung heavily skinned android for this device while there are some positives as mentioned above there are far more negatives the interface can be very laggy when swiping or loading apps double-tapping the home button brings up a samsung app instead of the list of running apps swiping up brings up a samsung magazine app and it is sensitive enough that i accidentally opened it constantly samsung chose to go with hard buttons which are fine in landscape in portrait however the buttons are on the side this position is not only inconvenient and unfamiliar but it also is where you put your fingers to hold it so you often accidentally hit the home button standby battery life is terrible for constant use the battery compares to the ipad but in standby you lose 15-20 of battery life over the course of a day if you have gotten use to leaving your tablet lying around unplugged don't plan on it with this device no led battery charging indicator on the device or adapter.in the end the cons won out and i sent the device back to amazon for a refund before sending it back i purchased the sony xperia tablet z http://www.amazon.com/sony-xperia-sgp311u1-10-1-inch-tablet/dp/b00ce590z0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&qid;=1396645920&sr;=8-1&keywords;=sony+tablet+z while the specs of this device suggest it will be slower that is not the case since it is very lightly skinned the performance is great it is also much lighter and thinner than the galaxy_note and has much better standby battery life comparable to the ipad to top it off it is cheaper unless you need the wacom support from the galaxy_note i highly recommend you check out the xperia tablet z...you'll be happier with it\n",
      "i'm very impressed with the samsung galaxy_note 10.1 2014 edition.i already had a samsung galaxy_s3 phone and having the ability to link them seamlessly was great.i'm able to access the internet without any problem and the video display is terrific for movies.a nice travel size tablet\n",
      "i am generally please with this it is fast the resolution is very good new features are nice i like the improved s pen capabilities the only thing i am rather disappointed in is the display of some colors in some of my applications yellows in particular seem to have a greenish cast to them and appear dull and not as bright as i would like them colors are not as vibrant when i am working in sketchbook pro on this device as they are on my other galaxy_note 10.1 device i thought maybe it was just me or the devices but when i open a painting i did in sketchbook pro on one of my windows and mac laptops the yellows appear vibrant like they do when viewed on the original galaxy_note 10.1 some of the other colors are not as bright either.i give this device 4.5 stars if it weren't for the color problem i'm experiencing i would give it five stars\n",
      "not near as elegant a physical design as the apple air ipad but the galaxy_note 10.1 2014 is reasonably well-designed the operating system beats the ipad hands-down more complex to learn but is so much more flexible and powerful apps can be highly integrated with the android 4.2 operating system unlike the ipad i have a samsung note 3 mobile phone and this tablet uses the same user approach and stylus technology make sure you get the 2014 version of this tablet a minor point i wish the charger port were in a different location as it interferes with fully using my case in all configurations note-taking with s-note is amazing it is very functional and can save your notes to picture or pdf format for mailing to others see my reviews for the case that i really like for this device i wish the 34;menu&#34 and 34;back&#34 capacitive 34;buttons&#34 were closer to the outer edges to make them easier to use with my case but this is only a minor complaint the fact that it and the note 3 phone actually have a 34;back&#34 34;button&#34 is so helpful unlike the iphone/ipad which does not have one i have no issue with the size or design/build of the stylus 32g of internal memory with the ability to add up to a 64gb microsd card is far better than how an ipad designs their approach to memory also you can configure the closing of an app when you swith to a different display/functionality which helps battery life otherwise i end up with a zillion apps running in the background thus draining my battery\n",
      "i had ordered this one by my incidence so i decided to get refund and change another one such as ultrabook of course each one has different functionality between tablet and ultarbook however as soon as i got this one i changed my mind this is really awesome and cool i already have galaxy_note 10.1 2013 but this is really awesome i definitely recommend this one \n",
      "i got this for my 2 year old grandson early christmas gift)had to because we all wanted our galaxy_note 10.1 2014 tablets back it comes preloaded with kid apps however i was able to add his favorite apps from amazon barnes and noble and netflix got a cute orange stylus with a monkey from walmart that matches it perfectly\n",
      "what is not to love it's a samsung product it's an android os and it's not an apple product win win and super win sorry i know apple makes decent products but i just don't like them!ok i digress on with the review.i have always had good luck with samsung products i have a galaxy_note phone and it's been great!so it was time to replace my tablet i had a kindle fire the original release it was a fine 7 inch tablet but it was time to upgrade and i wanted a true android operating system.i did my research and once this went on sale 50 off i jumped it has been great can you say fast wow the quad-core processor is amazing it's so fluid and smooth i like how easy it is to operate and how light this tablet is considering it's a 12.2 inch tablet i mean it's not lighter than air but it's also much larger than any good tablet on the market the freebies that come with it are a nice added bonus but the tablet is worth every dime i paid for it and the 50 i didn't!the s pen is great i love the s pen on my galaxy_note phone and it's even nicer on such a large screen great for drawing writing whatever you want to do with a pen you can do with this s pen!this tablet is so fast and responsive on wi-fi and makes browsing a dream i tether at work with my phone and it works great too the display is amazing best picture i have seen in a long time watching movies in hd is flawless and beautiful it's almost immersive and a bit mesmerizing the speakers actually produce clear crisp sound in stereo or even surround it's a pleasant experience to say the least.you are drawn in by its beautiful picture and the 12.2 inch screen is the perfect size for watching tv/movies anywhere great job samsung this is the best product i have purchased in a long time.honestly for what you get it is priced just right it's not expensive at all for what you get i purchased this product for fun leisure and enjoyment if you want a fantastic beautiful large screen tablet i truly think there is no reason to look further i love android so it's the android of choice for me.i did not buy this product from amazon.com even though i love them i got a better deal buying it through costco not on the price of the tablet mind you same price but on the price of the extended warranty.first you get two years of warranty on all electronics you buy from costco secondly you have a ninety day return policy and thirdly the extended drops spills warranty i purchased was about a fourth of the price for something comparable on amazon.com so that's the only reason i didn't purchase from amazon.com.i will probably update this review as time goes on but for now i say make the jump you won't be sorry.for the millions that have abandoned apple and switched to android if you haven't yet but are tired of apple's overpriced antics this would be a good first experience with samsung and all that android's operating system can do for you.also while i love my little kindle and as i mentioned before i wanted a true android os not an amazon hybrid i would have purchased another kindle fire if it had a larger screen and it would be nice to have google play on kindle fire too just sayin.so go by this tablet you won't be sorry you will be happy like me p.s i wanted a 90 day return policy just in case i had buyer's remorse sometimes with large ticket items i have buyer's remorse i am here to tell you that didn't and won't happen i am connected to this bad boy i take it everywhere and why not it can do anything ll be happy like me \n",
      "i have had my note pro for a few days being a owner of the samsung galaxy_note 10.1 2012 this is much better than the original note i first got it yes it is a big tablet to be exact it almost covers my hp 17 laptop's keyboard.a side note on the s pen it is the same design as the note 3 however the size is different it is a little bit longer and a little bit bulkier.when i took it out of the box it was about 60 charged took about 3ish hours to fully charge and this is partially due to the processor i charge my note 3 from completely dead to 100 in about 2.5 hours.as far as the magazine on home i personally am not a fan of it i like how you can swype up on the note 3 to get the magazine the hancom office is very useful i now have no need to get microsoft office 2013 for my laptop.speakers are better sounding on the sides as i can also close my case and listen to music clearly app to sd card transfer is adequate screen is very sharp very clear with my live wallpaper in the background.there has been some slight problems with lag time but i am used to it from my old note 10.1 there is a reason why i knocked it down from 5 to 4 not because of anything but the price 850.00 is very expensive for a tablet as my laptop was cheaper and it has the new intel i7 processor the starting price should be 600 for the 32gb 700 for the 64gb instead of buying through amazon i bought directly from samsung because they included the cover for it extremely flimsy not protective at all and they didn't charge for tax savings of about 70 dollars and change\n",
      "this tablet is a perfect fit for me the apps that were included such as drop box remote pc and the hancom suite provide all the flexibility i require in a tablet i also purchased a usb 3.0 9 pin flash disk adapter cable i store videos on thumb drives and view them on the tablet i very rarely use my desk top computer any more stopped delivery of the newspapers my wife and i eash have samsung tablets  she has a galaxy_note 10.1 so no more waiting for the newspaper to be delivered in the am all our favorite news feeds are on the tablet and we have more room when we have our coffee at the kitchen table\n",
      " updated 5/8/2014  if you're using dolphin browser with adobe flash player do yourself a favor and do not update dolphin browser if prompted to in the google playstore it seems like every time they update dolphin there's a chance for flash to no longer work without jumping through more hoops i come from a windows os background and i'm an ex-apple iphone now galaxy_note 2 and ipad user i've been waiting a long time for a tablet like this to be released a large screen expandable memory and the freedom of android thanks to my note 2 i have a little over a years of experience with android os but i knew what to expect from the note pro 12.2 originally i had my eyes set on thesamsung galaxy_note 10.1 2014 edition 32gb black after months of waiting and playing i decided to bite the bullet and buy it just before doing so i read of a possible 12 model coming out in the following year so i figured another 6 weeks of waiting can't hurt and patience definitely paid off.comparing the note 10.1 2014 edition and the note pro 12.2:one big issue that annoyed me with the note 10.1 2014 edition 14e was the ridiculous my magazine app that never goes away it constantly hogs system resources as it runs in the background even after forcing shut downs of the app and disabling the home button link to this app didn't help as it would just keep running in the background i noticed that the 14e was constantly using 1.5-1.7gb of its 3gb ram total at all times even after factory resets disabling apps and reboots thankfully the note pro 12.2 np12 doesn't have this issue as it hovers around 1.2gb of memory used after a reboot even having pages of the magazine feeds and widgets running it still allocates memory usage better and best of all no pesky my magazine app!luckily i was able to compare both tablets side by side at the local best buy this was a large factor in my decision to go with the np12 over the 14e both tablets are about the same when it comes to hardware but there are other major differences between the two let's go over some of the features that the np12 has over the 14e...1 over 2 extra inches of real estate on the screen this means writing on the np12 with the stylus while in portrait mode is very much like writing on a real piece of 8.5 by 11 inch piece of paper aka standard notebook paper the palm rejection does a great job of making sure only the stylus gets recognized for input if you want that on i find that a 10 inch screen is too cramped to comfortably write notes on do your research this is a 12 inch tablet so don't be surprised and don't consider it a downside.2 larger longer lasting battery rated at 13 hours 9,500 mah versus the 14e's 9 hours 8,220 mah my mixed use gets me anywhere from 8 to 12 hours before plugging it in for a charge depending on what apps i'm using and what the brightness/volume is set at lots of gaming/graphic intensive apps will exhaust the battery quickly whereas reading pdfs e-books etc is where the battery really stretches its legs there are numerous settings and options for the tablet to use minimum energy which i will go over later.3 multitasking on the np12 is fantastic multi window allows you to run 2 3 or 4 apps on screen at once the 14e supports up to 2 apps side by side there are many apps compatible with multi window you can also resize the windows depending on where you need the most room on the screen chatting with friends on hangouts surfing on dolphin browser watching your favorite movie and checking/writing emails all on the same screen is productivity at it's finest you can save multi window templates too for quick access so that you don't need to drag the apps one by one every time you want to multitask just select your template and all the apps open up automatically i usually have 3 apps going at once video or music at the top left aquamail at the bottom left and dolphin browser taking up the entire right side of the screen.bonus feature there is a trick that allows more than 4 apps open at once on the np12 up to 9 apps total first use multi window to load up whatever 4 apps you want on the screen then hold the s-pen above the screen and press the pen's button which bring up air view on the air view pop-up select pen window now use the s-pen to draw a box and then choose an app to launch in that box the app loads up in the box you drew it comes up as a floating window that can be resized moved around on the screen and also minimized to a floating bubble that you can move around anywhere you want you can do this 5 times total so 4 apps via multi window and 5 apps via pen window the multi window apps are all joined on the main screen while the 5 pen window apps are solo floating windows and can be minimized to a bubble to have them out of the way pretty cool!4 kitkat 4.4 the new magazine home user interface ui is a little like windows 8 but at the same time its different after playing with it for a little while you'll actually want to use it and set up multiple pages filled with your news subscriptions feeds widgets etc i did not think i would like the dashboard/widget style ui but on a screen this size it works well and looks great basically you can set up different pages filled with all sorts of widgets ranging from:application widgets email calendar music video etc.)social widgets twitter flickr youtube etc.)news widgets art  culture science  technology news style sports business etc.)each news category has dozens and dozens of publications to subscribe to and i find myself spending more time reading articles than i ever thought i would if you're not a fan of the new ui the familiar android desktop is still there with your standard icons and widgets if you'd rather customize the tablet completely i highly recommend nova launcher.those are the main differences to me now onto some general information about the tablet as well as apps i use and features worth checking out:like every other phone tablet and computer out there the np12 does come with some bloatware there are different types of bloatware so i'll cover each one:1 some preloaded apps can be uninstalled completely giving you back some minor storage space this is a good thing.2 some preloaded apps cannot be uninstalled and instead can have most of their data cleared and then turned off  these apps remain installed on the tablet but are disabled some of the preloaded apps that can only be turned off are chrome e-meeting dropbox gmail google twitter cisco webex and others these are just some that i do not use myself so i turned them off even when turned off/disabled these apps still take up some room but its very little 5mb or less per app.3 some apps cannot be uninstalled nor can they be turned off they can have most of their data cleared though either way this is just plain stupid i can only think of two off the top of my head evernote and remotepc i don't use these particular apps at all so why can't i at least disable them so they don't show up in my apps list both of these apps use about 9mb of space combined again it's not a deal breaker for me but samsung y u do dis?!i bought the 32gb model the tablet needs about 6-6.5gb for the operating system and preloaded software/apps out of the box you have around 25.5gb of space to play with this of course depends on what preloaded apps you choose to keep/update or disable/uninstall so your free space will vary a great investment would be asandisk ultra 64 gb microsdxc class 10 uhs-1 memory card 30mb/s with adapter sdsdqua-064g-u46a which gives you another 60gb of extra space for apps movies music pictures whatever you want to put on it this sd card plus the tablet's free space adds up around 85gb which for me was more than enough it's very easy adding your media files to the sd card just plug the card into your pc with the supplied adapter and create folders like music movies etc then copy/paste or drag and drop artists folders into the music folder and videos into the movies folder i loaded music movies and pictures on the sd card and i leave the tablet's internal storage for apps since applications seem to run faster off of the internal storage as opposed to off the sd card if you think you need more space you can go big with sandisk's newest 128gb card also found on amazon.the screen is beautiful high quality photographs and wallpapers at the native resolution 2560x1600 or bigger look really really good if you're looking for some stunning wallpaper for your tablet check out:interfacelift.com/wallpaper/downloads/date/widescreen_16:10/2560x1600/this model is wifi only there is no slot for a sim card the wifi model also works with your mifi device and can also connect to the internet via a mobile hotspot such as your iphone or galaxy_smartphones i use my note 2 smartphone as a mobile hotspot and it works great.if you are looking for the 4g/lte version you'll need to check out the model that verizon offers it's available through verizon or here on amazon just search note pro 12.2 verizon\"gps  yes the tablet has gps built in you do not need to be connected to the internet for gps to work such as the google maps app).hancom office is included with the np12 this is microsoft office for android simple as that you get full versions of word processing word spreadsheets excel and slideshow powerpoint it all works very well with the large 12.2 screen and i find it very familiar after using ms office for so long you can even open existing word excel and powerpoint documents with hancom office and continue editing and creating hancom office is fantastic however i must admit it was a little involved to get it up and running so i will explain as best i can after the initial setup of your np12 go to your apps bottom right little white squares and launch the samsung apps app it will require an update so go ahead and download then install the update after that is done go back to your apps and launch hancom viewer there is also a hancom widget in one of the two default magazine home screens if you want to launch it that way when you launch it a small white box should come up and it will say installing fonts and files etc so let it do that and when its done the hancom viewer app should open completely on the left side select office download then ok this should open the hancom office update manager when you do this there's a good chance the update manager will prompt you to update it so go ahead and do that after its updated you can launch it again the hancom office update manager is where all the hancom apps are downloaded/updated/installed you'll see 12 rows of hancom apps such as hcell hshow hwp etc update and/or install all the ones that need to be done by pressing the rectangular button at the far right of each row each time you press the install or update button on the far right it will take you to samsung apps where you can press the update button go ahead and update all 12 apps if needed some may already be updated but will need to be installed or vice versa once every button on all 12 rows is greyed out in hancom office update manager then you know you're done now just go to your apps and launch whichever one you like hcell is excel hshow is powerpoint and hword is word processor.hangouts is a cool app and it comes with the tablet it lets you text/message anyone with an email address or phone number if you are familiar with imessage then you know what this is updated belowdolphin browser is a must for surfing the web it is fast supports tabs and has a cool feature named speed dial a speed dial is a bookmark placed on the dolphin home screen for easy one-tap access to the webpage you can have pages of speed dials its very useful and beats going down a list of bookmarks looking for a particular site.perhaps the best feature of dolphin browser is that it supports adobe flash and java i bet your ipad can't do that what is adobe flash many of the websites you visit require flash to display the content properly some websites even have flash animation and to play those you will need the flash player one example of flash required content is youtube videos and youtube videos that are embedded in other websites here is how to enable flash on the np12:cultofandroid.com/49840/install-flash-player-android-4-4-kitkat note the link to download the flash player installer on the website above is broken here is an updated working link for the flash player installer downloadandroidfiles.org/files/apps%20%28apk%29/kitkat.adobe.flash.player.11.1.apkwhen you're all done installing flash player you should head over to the official adobe flash website to test the flash player so that you know it works on the website you should see a bouncing red box if not just refresh the page and you should see it the second time around the adobe page to test your flash player is:adobe.com/software/flash/about/protip once you get dolphin browser and flash player up and running do not update dolphin browser in the playstore unless absolutely necessary it's not worth taking the chance of the update messing up flash player.amazon instant videos  yes you can watch them on this tablet yes you'll need dolphin browser and adobe flash installed and correctly configured if you followed the aforementioned links you should be all set by now here is another link specifically dealing with streaming amazon instant videos on kitkat 4.4 which is the tablet's operating system this worked for me and it should work for you!:the-digital-reader.com/nates-reviews/stream-amazon-instant-videos-android-tablet updated abovesplashtop 2 remote desktop is a remote desktop app that you can download for free and in my opinion works better than the remotepc app that comes preloaded on the tablet this app allows you to access your pc or mac's desktop environment so that you basically have your entire pc/mac on your tablet it takes advantage of the 12.2 screen by filling it entirely with your computer's desktop this is useful since you can run all your pc/mac programs right on your tablet it works really well and is probably my favorite app that i have come across there is an optional paid upgrade to the app that let's you remote into your pc/mac from anywhere for now i am just using the free version to access my windows pc very cool and worth the download.if you want to connect this tablet to your hdtv a projector or anything with an hdmi input you'll need a samsung mhl hdmi adapter this adapter allows you to mirror your tablet's screen onto your hdtv or other source i also noticed that you can play a movie on the tablet which also displays on your tv and still use the tablet for other apps while the movie plays uninterrupted in the background of the tablet but still in full view on the tv in other words you can play your movies or shows on the big screen while surfing the net or whatever apps you want to use on the tablet this adapter is available here on amazon but i chose to buy mine off of ebay if the one sold on amazon does not say shipped and sold by amazon there is a good chance you will get a cheap knockoff adapter that will not work just read the reviews from other buyers for yourself if you want to try your luck the adapter can be found here:samsung et-h10fauwesta micro usb to hdmi 1080p hdtv adapter cable for samsung galaxy_s3/s4 and note 2  retail packaging  white the seller i found on ebay is selling the legitimate samsung adapters that have the hologram sticker and qr code on the box indicating that it is a genuine samsung product mine arrived promptly and works great save yourself the headache and get a genuine one here ebay.com/itm/350958988570bluetooth is available so you can connect a bt mouse and keyboard if you like samsung makes an s action mouse especially for the note pro and tab pro line of tablets and it works very well the mouse buttons are specifically linked to actions such as recent apps multi window back menu etc i got to play with this mouse recently and it's fun although i opted not to buy it as i don't see me using the mouse enough if you are interested its available at best buy search et-mp900dbeguj and here on amazon:samsung s mouse for tablets et-mp900dbeguj)you can also connect usb peripherals to the tablet using a usb otg cable like this:black color micro usb 3.0 9pin otg host flash disk cable for samsung galaxy_note3 n900 n9000 10cm this allows you to connect a number of usb devices such as a mouse keyboard flash drive external hard drive even a playstation 3 controller to the tablet with the ability to access them  if you have a lot of movies on your external hard drive you can use the otg cable to connect it to the tablet to watch movies another example is if you have a thumb drive on your keys you can connect it to the tablet to access all your files you can connect more than one usb device at a time by using a usb hub along with the otg cable mentioned before i don't recommend connecting more than two devices at the same time in the usb hub especially if its a device that sucks up a lot of power like an external hard drive.netflix vudu amazon kindle google earth all work great no issues if you want to stream video from the tablet to your smart tv like apple airplay check out the allcast application made for android devices.extending battery life is simple disable the vibration/haptic feedback and keyboard/stylus sounds as it really isn't necessary keep the brightness on auto and the volume at half or less when you're done using it for a while make sure you close all your apps and clear your ram before putting it to sleep this will greatly increase the standby time of the tablet so that when you pick it up again later it will still have lots of juice left in it this is the procedure i do:swipe down the top of the screenclear your notifications by pressing the x under the sound barswipe down the top of the screen againturn off wifi important)press the recent apps soft button to the left of the home button)select close allpress the recent apps button again no apps should be running now)select task managerselect ram manager on the leftpress clear memory  do this after closing your appspress home buttonpress recent apps button a third timeselect close all this closes task manager)press power button to put it in sleep/standby modedoing the above every time sounds tedious but after a few times its second nature and you will notice the battery percentage stays where you left it or it only drops only 1 or 2 even after an entire 24 hours in standby.if you notice when opening/closing apps and switching between apps there is a slight visual delay this is normal it is meant to make the transition between apps look pretty  microsoft os and apple ios have something similar this will eliminate

and does protect the back and corners well the stand works well in both positions don't plan on taking too many pictures with this cover though because when opened the cover wraps around the back and blocks the camera lens that is ok though because you should never be using a tablet to take pictures ever stop no don't do it you look ridiculous i'm pretty sure there is a law against this  ipadisnotacamera.com  i rest my case.anyway i bought mine at the local best buy and you can find it on bestbuy.com  search for samsung book cover 12.2\"the ivso slim smart cover case is nice too and protects the tablet a little better than the samsung book cover but i find the ivso's stand to be a little more flimsy and i don't like that it makes the tablet sit upside down home button on top when using it in your lap on the plus side the camera lens isn't covered with this cover and there's a thin magnet that holds the cover to the tablet so it doesn't flop around.ivso samsung galaxy_note pro

      "i have a galaxy_note 3 upgraded from the note 1 and so when this came out i upgraded from my galaxy_note 10.1 the larger screen is a welcome change especially using office apps in a pinch the screen is gorgeous the tablet is generally easy to use with the added features using the pen it performs quite well and the battery is good for several days of normal use.i wished samsung included a micro usb to standard usb otg adapter would make using existing extras easier but overall love this tablet!would be nice to set google now as one of the home screens instead of just an app you can access\n",
      "1 os and app bugswhile the tablet is beautiful after using it for almost two months i find it shockingly buggy apparently there's a battery drain problem in sleep mode my note pro goes from 100 to dead in 18 hours of no use it drops about 5 every 30 minutes many apps i expected to be mature and debugged like nytimes wall street journal are laggy and crash frequently moving from an ipad to the galaxy_note pro i have to say that there's something to be said about the benefits of how apple manages expectations downward while there is no multitasking on the ipad as there is on the galaxy there's a lot of lag and failed swipes on the galaxy never on the apple.2 many apps haven't been updated for this larger screenlots of apps appear in the wrong orientation and/or won't rotate or appear in one quadrant of the screen.3 chrome won't work the way you think it will workif you were expecting a more desktop or at least laptop)-like chrome experience forget it the version of chrome that installs on this tablet is designed for smartphones no plug-ins allowed no bookmark bar bookmarks appear in a tab window instead of a drop-down/slide-out.4 big problems when using a chromecastexpect your note pro to crash when attempting the seemingly simple task of streaming music from google play to your chromecast device easy-to-reproduce and requires a tablet reboot only to happen again when you try streaming music.5 nobody knows anything about this thingnot samsung not verizon i have the lte version other than the basics at least as of two weeks in nobody knows anything about the galaxy_note pro.6 bloatwareoh my goodness they're redefined the phrase i appreciate some of the freebies but wouldn't it have been possible to remove the ones i don't use google hangouts knox and of course knox store whatever that is e-meeting etc etc7 a mouse!ok so i was amazed yes with a bluetooth mouse connected an arrow icon actually appears on the screen and you can use it pretty much like any mouse on a conventional pc i'm using the microsoft sculpt touch mouse but any bluetooth one will work you can also connect a keyboard at the same time.8 limited amount of accessories and ridiculous prices thereofbecause of its newness there are a limited number of accessories and cases for this tablet furthermore i guess because companies like zagg and logitech believe you're willing to overpay for the tablet they can charge you a premium for accessories 129 for a keyboard/case you must be kidding.9 amazon video/flash player:streaming video from your amazon account is almost impossible i was accustomed to using amazon's streaming video app on the ipad to watch tv shows and movies i get from amazon there is no such app for android devices this is very unlike amazon and google but less so for adobe and i wish they would get over themselves and help their customers btw there are no problems watching netflix youtube or hulu using their respective apps.10 the guys at adobe or someplace will make sure you can't use this as a notebook replacementgetting flash installed on this tablet is an exercise in contortion it can be done via the installation of an obscure dolphin browser an older version of adobe flash and then jimmying with settings to put it all together but it's complicated especially with this tablet running kitkat i was successful but it took a while i understand this is because of a disagreement between google android's developer amazon and adobe.11 amazon or someone doesn't want you streaming your library on the note pro:there is no amazon streaming app as there is for the ipad see 10 above this is very unlike amazon and google but less so for adobe and i wish they would get over themselves and help their customers btw there are no problems watching netflix youtube or hulu using their respective apps.12 new charging  sync connector on cordthe note pro uses a new micro usb 3.0 connector it's wider than the one that the entire rest of the planet uses you can use an old-style micro usb charger but it takes much longer to charge it than if you use the cord that comes with it also there are no usb 3.0 car chargers that i've been able to find anyways also all those zillions of usb chargers you own many of them won't charge the galaxy_note pro.13 pricing and obsolescencethe professional reviews of this tablet are lukewarm mostly revolving around the reviewer's opinion of its high price and who would want a tablet with this large of a screen these reviews can slow sales and drive the price down the price of this tablet may decline at a faster rate than usual what's weird is that even the reviews that start like that often end up with a conclusion that it's a terrific product i don't get it.update other thoughts:i've been using this device intensively for almost two months now as a replacement for an aging ipad and hopefully a replacement for an infrequently used notebook if you're used to holding an ipad this tablet will take some getting used to once you've had it for a few days you won't want to take your hands off of it for me it is a near-notebook replacement especially if you add a keyboard and a mouse the hancom office software is shockingly close in appearance and functionality to microsoft office\n",
      "first let me say that i am an ex-apple customer that demanded more options and over time have switched from the iphone to note 3 and from an ipad to the surface pro and now to the galaxy_note pro 12.2 for those that have a galaxy_note phone the note pro tablet is more than just a larger version of the same the functionality is greater the multitasking is excellent and from both a personal and business use it has met my every expectation i will address a few areas of concern i had before purchase to try and help anyone that may be feeling the way i was.size  my job has me on the road marketing every day this tablet to me is portable enough to not be a problem or feel like i am lugging around something uncomfortable i carry a clip board with a few forms and the note pro 12.2 in a slip cover case until i can get my hands on the book cover case which is back ordered when i read the initial reviews i was terrified to buy this thing sight unseen as many talked about it being too big or too heavy it is not too big and the weight feels light next to the surface pro if you are looking for a large tablet screen...this is for you also the large screen allows for the full size keyboard which is nice this review is being typed on the screen)magazine ux  the difference in the updated interface had me scared is it like the new windows tiles is it completely different than what i am used to on the galaxy_note 3 phone here is the deal the magazine ux is not bad i am not a fan of the new microsoft windows tiles which i had on the surface pro the ui is different and better in my opinion you can set up your tablet to look almost identical to your samsung note phone if that is what you want there has to be at least one screen of the magazine but to be honest i have it set up to where i really like it when i hit the button to go to the home screen it takes me to the same setup i have on my phone which is folders with different apps time and weather etc.32 or 64 gb  being an early adpoter the 64gb model was not available on release it is unlikely that you will be using this tablet to shoot a ton of hd video which is the biggest storage hog and with an addition of a 64gb sd card that you can swap out if needed 32gb device memory works just fine.wifi or 4g  that depends on your needs but if you can use your phone as a hotspot why pay extra for a cell radio in the device plus pay more to add it to a cell plan the answer for my needs was wifi works perfect and tethers with my phone on the road.i can't say much about the battery life yet as i have only charged it once it had about 50 charge when i pulled it out of the box after purchase.conclusion  i was disappointed in the info updates on this device before the us release all of the videos and reports were all from ces and there were no new hands on reports i can tell you that this device has a premium price but also carries premium capabilities if you just want to update a status on facebook and play candycrush...this isn't for you unless you want to spend the money for the screen size if you want a nice big screen to multitask and you are either familiar with android or are willing to educate yourself on the possibilities you will be impressed\n",
      "i already had a galaxy_note 10.1 2014 i passed it down to my wife and bought the note pro 12.2 the note pro doesn't work with smart view or watch on correctly maybe there will be updates later overall i love it so far this is the sweet spot as far as screen size\n",
      "i updated the tablet from the first galaxy_note tablet to this one i am so surprised that the samsung provided a lot of their technologies to make tablets much better now i am using this tablet instead of using my window 8 laptop i am a graphic designer and illustrator thus i am drawing ideas often and this tablet has all what i was looking for.this one comes with the free sketchbook pro for galaxy you do not have to buy any of apps to draw it is enough to draw and colorings.if you are so concering about the touch sensitivities i recommend the ipad because this tablet does not seem that the sensitivities are so great.if you are making a lot of notes this tablet is going to be your favorite the s note does not read your hand sensitivity but only the pen thus you can simply draw or write with your hand laying on the screen as if wacom tablets\n",
      "thanks to windows xp support slowly expiring i needed a new laptop and at the same time a tablet for school we are using mostly ebooks i realize this might not be a complete laptop alternative for some people but i really only need to create/edit documents word excel web browsing and media consumption  all of which this tablet does for me.the tablet is larger than others so it does take adjusting but i already love it i also have the galaxy_note 3 and it actually makes my phone feel small it is heavier than smaller tablets but considering the size i don't know if you could expect it to be much lighter.the android version of office is very nice and offers a familiar feel i ordered a blue tooth keyboard the anker model i think it would become tedious to type long documents using the tablet alone but the keyboard pairs nicely and works great.i love that it has an expandable micro sd slot as the bloatware does take up space i stick with sandisk models because i already know and trust their products.the screen display is very nice it has a nice crisp picture as other's have stated it has the same resolution as the 10.1 models so technically the smaller screens will look better  but i personally haven't noticed much of a difference i haven't had any problems with lag nice work samsung!i rooted the device and synced all my game progress from my phone and games like plants vs zombies look awesome on a big screen i look forward to learning even more things i can do with this device.ps the multi-window feature is awesome i love being able to run multiple apps at a time and didn't realize how useful this would be as mentioned i am rooted so i can multi-window any app;)edit i've been using this for over a month now and it's awesome the multi-window feature is so helpful i can view the powerpoints on the left and take notes in hword on the right the girl sitting next to me with an ipad is jealous\n",
      "i have had the galaxy_note pro for about 2 weeks now and i love it the onscreen keyboard is the best i have ever used you get a full row of number keys plus a delete and a a backspace and a ctrl key you can even highlight text and use windows style copy and paste keystrokes the multi windows function is easy to use the 34;show open apps&#34 key is one of three keys on the bezel along with home and back and can be used any time.i have not used the stylus much except to play around with notes and drawing a small window to open another app on screen it's great that the stylus fits snugly into a slot in the bezel i was worried i would lose it but that's not likely.the only thing that was at all cumbersome was getting the amazon app store to download but i think that was because neither google nor samsung want it to be easy\n",
      "very happy with the graphics and speed of this tablet with power saving mode on and using thmenu system is easy to use and chock full of features too i misht be bold to say this suite turnse tablet moderately with a variety of apps i was able to get more than 10 hours out of the battery i was mainly inside so i was able to use the tablet with a lot lower screen brightness than i would if i had been outside this will make a difference and in this case the tablet will not yield 10 hours.the main disappointment of this tablet and my  main reason of giving the tablet 3 stars is the fact that external sd card storage capability is greatly diminished due to its use of android 4.4 the only apps that will be able to save our modify data on the external sd card are pre installed applications so the stock camera hancom office suite etc will work if you install a custom camera or any thing else from google play at the time of this writing you cannot save data or move the apps to sd card you can however still read from the sd card any modified files will have to be saved to the internal storage i don't like this restriction and i can't possible see any good coming out of it if you rely heavily on sd card usage do not buy this tablet if however you can get by with the roughly 22gb of storage you have left after installing hancom office then it shouldn't be a problem people might say to blame google and not let this affect the product rating but this limitation affects my experience and samsung and other manufacturers should pressure google into fixing this!speaking of hancom office when you get your new tablet it comes with the hancom viewer pre-installed but you must install the applications to be able to edit and create documents i can't speak for everyone but the download install and updates took a very long time several hours i was not on a slow connection my home router is an ac one which this tablet utilizes very well although you must manually download the application you are still able to save and modify files on the sd card one last note on this is that you may manage the hancom updates through the included hancom office updater but it is not managed through google play or samsung apps.hancom office is the best android ms office replacement i've tried beats all the others hands down i don't want to do a full review on this application as you can go to youtube and watch hands on videos of it but i will tell you it has many of the features word excel and powerpoint have and by default saves files in these formats i'm a heavy user of excel and it was hard to find an excel formula that wasn't recognized with word you have access to shapes etc which the other office replacements don't even come close to having.have access to shapes pictures fonts formatting etc which the other office replacements don't even come close to having the menu system is easy to use and chock full of features too i might be bold to say this suite turns this tablet into a productive mobile office it might not have all the features you need but it's real close.as with all galaxy_note products this tablet comes with the s-pen which works very well the integrated handwriting to text application is very accurate too i have sloppy handwriting and it recognizes my handwriting better than swype does of course swype is much faster but for those who like to write old school you will be fascinated i only wish you could control the pause delay time because i wind up making mistakes when i pause for a second because the text moves to the left side of the screen before i'm done writing it's not a big deal but i'd like more control over that what's really cool is that when you install an additional language the handwriting to text engine recognizes the words of the currently selected language not just english.the sketchbook pro app included pre-installed is very awesome if you are an artist checkout youtube and search for  galaxy_note 12.2 sketchbook pro even if you're not an artist it's still awesome anyway.0verall i would recommend this tablet to anyone without the need of saving data to the external from user installed applications or attempting to move apps to ext sd card\n",
      "samsung proves what the ladies already know bigger is better the 12.2 note pro has received a high percentage of positive reviews on amazon and other sites most professional reviewers on the other hand seem to think it's just too big too heavy too expensive or it's just not an ipad fortunately for me i've learned to take professional reviewers with a huge grain of salt thanks to reviews from real users on amazon and balanced reviewers like lisa gade from mobile tech review i was able to take the plunge when the note pro went on sale.and i love my big ass tablet bat i wasn't sure i could use that word in my review but i did a search on amazon and found out they sell thisliquid assso i guess it's okay.i've owned two 7 tablets two 10.1 tablets and i recently bought the samsung tab pro 8.4 the 7 were good for portability outside the home while the 10.1 were good for couch surfing i thought the 8.4 would be a good compromise between the two that i could use for both and consolidate down to one size however after using the 8.4 for about a month i discovered my eyes aren't up to looking at a small screen for several hours at a time reading/web surfing on the couch is my favorite past-time the 8.4 has great resolution but text is still small and zooming in just means you have to scroll a lot however it is great for portability outside the home and i will keep it for that.the 12.2 offers no compromise web browsing and document reading rarely do i feel the need to zoom in i'm also addicted to the s-pen love to use it for navigating my tablet and i also prefer to write with the pen then use the onscreen keyboard i guess it's samsung tablets for me until the competition catches up and produces something better.some people might complain that the tablet is too heavy for couch surfing i've solved this problem by modifying the aerb case i got for the tabletaerb x pro series samsung galaxy_note pro 12.2 leather case cover stand w sleep wake function for galaxy_note pro 12.2 black style a)by folding the cover of the case and securing it with four small binding clips i can use the case to prop up the tablet while lying on the couch or in bed weight becomes a non-issue and i only need to lightly grasp the tablet with one hand to keep it from tipping over i've included some pictures to show you how i modified the case for those that are interested see the user supplied picture area of this product's web page).so far i'm completely satisfied with this tablet my only complaint is the price wish it was more like 600.even so i'm livin large and lovin it i hope samsung keeps making this size tablet it's ideal for my use\n",
      "i got this because i wanted a tablet with a big screen to run the kindle app in portrait had to be android or ios  the windows kindle app doesn't load 34;personal documents&#34 from the cloud and this was the biggest one commonly available i also wanted a bigger screen to connect to my home computer when i'm out.i had recently gotten a galaxy_note phone and was happy with that so i took the plunge and the galaxy_note pro delivers on its promises the kindle app is one of the most difficult for an android device to run in my experience and the app and all apps runs very smoothly with none of the glitches and lagginess found on less powerful android tablets.if you're considering this tablet it's because you're willing to pay a premium for a honking huge screen and a strong processor i'd say it's worth the price on that basis i've found little to complain about i'm using the zagg keyboard cover  an external keyboard makes this an excellent laptop replacement the remotepc app that comes with the tablet has not worked well but i already use logmein if you're counting on remotepc you should look into people's experiences with that app\n",
      "update i wanted to revisit this review and tell you how it is going with this great product i have discovered playbook app and the ability to upload my rather extensive book library i use calibre with a drm removal program so that i can have all of the books i purchased available anywhere.i have had some issues getting this to sync with my samsung tv i have the remote control working and am able to control my tv just fine but i just can not get the screen mirroring to work it acts like it is going to connect and show up on my tv screen but then fails if anyone has an idea as to what i am doing wrong i would welcome your advise.it continues to function great and is getting free updates from samsung for software i really like the rubber back....around the house i do not need a cover.so you are thinking about buying one of these they are rather high in price but you do get a nice large screen and a lot of free software.....not what i would say is bloat ware for me bloatware consists of basic come ons that give me a few days for free and then i have to pay more money while that is true about some of the software much of what samsung offers up is free>i will not simply cut copy and paste the specs you can see those for yourself.this is a new type of device a natural evolution of a common device it is a new and fresh approach to this whole new category of consumer tablets new in that they are still in their diaper stage much change has happened to size and weight screens have become better and functions have increased.i like this device i am still learning how to use it my usage of windows 8.1 definitely helped me get going on this sure i know this is android but it does share some common characteristics with the surface pro2 i.e......you can have multiple applications running side by side.i like using the pen it is unlike any other pen i have used it communicates with the screen long before you ever touch it it is stowed in the side of the device i did not know this so i looked back through the box thinking they had forgotten to send it to me......then i found it.i was able to sync up my microsoft exchange account my cox account calendars contacts etc....i am able to use the amazon mp3 app to listen to my music i uploaded all of my music to the amazon mp3 cloud many months ago.dropbox works fine as does onedrive.like many people i have vision problems vision problems are not something for the aged it affects millions of people of all ages.the accessibility options are cool i have my voice over set for british female voice she sounds sexy i think i would like to meet her....anyone have raj's twitter account since he found siri maybe he can help me find my sexy british voice......(don't tell my wife that i am looking for her)sooooo with the pen out you just hover around the screen and it tells you exactly where you are touch the icon for settings or samsung apps and she will talk you through it all i have the power button set so that if i hold it down for two seconds it pulls up the accessibility options so i can turn her off just as easily as she turns me on.one caveat with the voice over on is that you have to use the pen finger touch does not work to change pages etc.....playbook a great way to get books and a fantastic way for those of us with vision problems to get the text just right.now that i have been using my new ipad air and this galaxy_note for reading i fully realize what i was missing using my amazon hdx 8.9 you can get the fonts way larger on the ipad air and the galaxy_note than the amazon device when i say bigger i mean bigger we are talking about the difference between say 40 font and 60 font.plus with the added real estate of the galaxy i can get around 15 words per page the playbook app also has free and always on text to speech you just move the pen to the top and click start speech.voce over works pretty much like on my imac it works with programs on the note i.e netflix voice over works with it and will read me what is on the screen a big plus for those of us with vision problems no more trying to find my high powered glasses...i can just activate voice over and use my lower powered 5.0 magnification glasses.sadly when i use the google playbook i have to listen to there rather robotic female american voice please google let me use the samsung british voice i think i love her.i bought one case for this but it just is not what i really want i have two of the ionic brand on order one is like there kindle hdx case and has a keyboard and the other is hopefully like a book\n",
      "i started back in the day with the samsung infuse as my first introduction to androids and haven't looked back since the majority of time spent on a pc is primarily entertainment and i've found androids to give the most seamless interactive environment for the majority of casual pc users while taking their interactions with their phones to levels once only dreamed of in science fiction a little backgrounds i am a a certified with a advanced degree in business management as well as network administration to say i'm partial to samsung is equivalent to saying i have a preference to live i've indoctrinated my entire family into the samsung family start i'm with the infuse i've gone through the entire galaxy line of phones and tablets for myself and my family from the s2 s3 s4 s5 phones to multiple tab 2 7.0 tab 2,10.1 the note 10.1 the note 8.0 and now the note pro 12.2(my favorite so far right now with my wife two kids and myself we have 2 s5 and 2 s4 phones and a note 8.0 wifi an 8.0 note at&t cellular and a galaxy_note 10.1 and my personal tablet the note pro 12.2 this list doesn't onclude the smart tv's blue ray players etcnow that i've exposed my strong personal bias towards samsung i have to tell you that the pro 12.2 is beyond most any other tablets you've worked with this has the closest thing you'll find to microsoft office installed on any android tablet the large screen and docking capabilities to use with an external keyboard is finally practical not to mention the incredible graphics the ability to run not just split windows but four windows that you can adjust the size for a more practical functionality then there is the capability to link different programs together so for example you can open your email app and your calender/appointment screen with one click allowing common tasks to be completed more efficiently i could go on and on about the benefits of this tablet however someone seriously looking for the best and aren't scared off by the price tag will be in a state of euphoric bliss after getting this tablet.as i've mentioned extensively hands down there isn't any better phone or tablet than samsung's i've played with a few others and unfortunately for a short time my kids fell into the peer pressure of having to have an apple that social conditioning and peer pressure fell victim to my children who could run circles around most pc and android user's  from rooting the device's and using open source software to create and modify their existing androids the apples had a very short shelf life in our house\n",
      "a 12.2 tablet really the first expression will be of gasp wide open mouth but this is reality let us compare the pro lines from samsung i will first compare the tabpros briefly and then give a crisp overview of the popular tablets in market now then i will do in depth into the current tablet itself this will give a good perspective and enhance your buying decision i am sure you are looking at multiple tablets to determine which suits you if you have any questions do ask in the forum and i will respond within a day the three galaxy_tabpros and the single galaxy_notepro differ only in size and little bit in specs they are functionally identical in all respects.the single most fascinating part of the tabpro and notepro lines is the resolution astounding 2560 x 1600 on all lines which means on 8.4 has the maximum ppi and excellent look in comparison last year's tabs have much lower resolution i personally think this 12.2 is heavy for personal purposes weight+cost was the primary reason for my rating at 4 stars for this price you can get a full blown laptop i got it for work purpose using with bluetooth keyboard and for personal purpose i will suggest the super

microusb port:yes gps yesyou should come up with three top three specs you want and should be able to nail it down with the above spec if you have doubts shoot me a comment i can help i have used several tablets over years!resolution:good to see tablets coming straight out with android v4.4 kitkat the resolution of wqxga 2560 x 1600 and has a pixel density of 247 ppi the videos were very crisp and text so sharp the new magazine ux interface makes the screen really pop i was able to read text very easily aldiko and many libraries have teamed up and magazines can be checked out through the app and they are super sharp resolution will blow you away this new multi-window ui that now supports up to four apps running simultaneously each in its dedicated window 12.2 is great for pdf books and magazines.processing power:exynos 5 octa 1.9ghz quadcore  1.3 ghz quadcore 3 gb ram very powerful indeed i have played games/watched youtube videos and have seen no lag or any latencies though the chip is octa core do bear in mind only 4 cores are active at a time this is done for minimizing heat.pro means?tablet is certainly is a productivity tool notepro is truly professional in nature this tablet is touted as enterprise-ready and has corporate e-mail/calendar/contact microsoft office-compatible mobile device management on-device encryption ode preloaded webex remote pc and e-meeting apps virtual private network it also has hancom office suite which is an office suite developer in korea hancom office consists of hanword hancell spreadsheet and hanshow presentation program since there is google office i don't know if this will be any market in the us and other countries all these apps are available in your other device yes you have it in your laptop!storage:notepro comes in 32/64 gb configurations having the expandable memory to 64 gb is the greatest invention since sliced bread well putting bunch of video/audio/books on the sd card which is so cheap these days the tablet suddenly has more memory with no lag observed with prices plummeting for 64 gb cards it is a great boon put all your music books photos on the sd card and you have a powerful computer in hand always i personally use the 64 gb microsd card on my mobile devices get this mobileultra sandisk 64gb mobile ultra microsdxc class 6 memory card with sd adapter  retail packaging.camera:having a camera is a plus on smaller tablets though i hate the feature on 10 or 12 tablets i personally don't use back cameras as much on 10 if you use publicly it is like having a big magazine in front of you imagine the guy in the sports stand using in front of you the resolution is 8mp rear  2mp front video is 1080p 60 fps nowadays there is nothing much to say of cameras they just work for the required purpose front camera is good for skype and business meetings.ergonomics:i personally like 8 for home uses but at 12 this is truly a laptop replacement i really wonder if this will have a market but it is an experiment from samsung at 748 gm the weight is definitely not single hand holdable this is 1.65 pounds still less weight than laptops for example 11 macbook air weighs 2.38 pounds size of this tablet is 11.64 x 8.03 x 0.33 in the battery is 9500mah and should come for easily couple of days for me at nominal usage the best part i liked is the beautiful resolution and is the best resolution on a tablet hd videos are crisp being a geek i love this form factor.sound:excellent sound system with stereo speakers and microphone i was able to ask questions to google now and get precise answers.misc:this is the only tablet i could see in samsung's lineup with microusb 3.0 port with backwards compatibility with microusb 2.0 i tested otg capability and it is great to have a external usb support usb host is one of the most undernoticed features of androids and is in my opinion one of the best features compared to ipad lines what this means you get a usb host cable also otherwise called otg on the go cables and plug in your usb thumb drive or other usb devices and the device recognizes it i have used it with alfa awus036h for a wireless project with android pcap capture from reputable kismet wireless wi-fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac dual-band is really state of the art 802.11ac is blazing fast!having a gps is great for immediate needs and i could get immediate lock on this tablet also has infrared which can be used for watchon as a tv remote control worked straightaway on samsung tv this is also great for sharing your tablet with family members multi user mode lets different users log in separately so you each see only your own apps backgrounds and email.obviously the s-pen is the one that differentiates this notepro from others s note docs s planner makes it so easy to organize with s-pen also this has nfc as well as ethernet connectivity via adapter i really doubt if people will use ethernet connectivity when wifi is used everywhere i really wonder what is the use case.app power:i tried following apps and they just worked awesome a tablet is only as good as the apps you have and how productive it makes you it's almost like the camera/lens analogy in the dslr space what good it is to have a great dslr body if you have no good lens same with tablet body and apps you have.wolframalpha i can go on for hours praising this this is a truly genius app powered by hundreds of supercomputers in the background wolfram is a computational genius well worth the 3 price.withings healthmate another remarkable app great ui/ux i use pulse and the integration with it as well as weight machine is very good.23andme app i love their reports)aldiko book reader premium absolutely love it many libraries have magazines for checkout)amazon mobileandroid statusandroid central

      "i've now been using one of these for about two weeks and love it much like my galaxy_note 8.0 i am able to use it asmy main machine at and obtain usb otg+mhl with an adapter i've had it's also so ginormous that i can just use it outright without a monitor.pros gorgeous 2560x1600 px 1280x800 dp screen extremely well suited to running two apps side by side and about the size of a sheet of paper it can do 4 apps in a grid and several pen windows at once but it really shines when you do two apps side by side the stock keyboard brings the worst of swiftkey's auto correct but offers a size  layout that you can type as close to a real keyboard as you can ever get on a touch screen loss of tactile feel but muscle memory can be retained for the letters and numbers likewise the web browsing experience is about as close to a chromebook tablet as you can get today as long as you pull up desktop websites i love that the screen can also get very dim not just hyper bright that helps save power when docked and spares the eyes in a dark room exynos 5 octa processor delivers great performance i was perfectly happy with exynos 4 quad prime's performance and this is quite an upgrade in engine and gpu power seems like the hardware now supports running all 8 cores at once and independantly but the software still switches between 4 x power saver and 4 x high performance cores in practice it works great unlike tegra 3 s-pen makes tablet life better between the note pro 12.2's giant screen and high resolution it is a pleasure to write on i use myscript stylus beta for the best handwriting recogition and more up to date bug fixes than the code samsung licensed swiftkey for kb mode myscript for hw mode it seems to use the same s-pen as the galaxy_note 3 much as my note 8 seems to use the one from the note 2 the new version of s-note is now superior to the inkredible app available on google play integrates far better with the android os and offers a seamless sync with evernote when set to use evernote as the sync account in settings apps like lecture notes and papyrus are still worth playing with if you want something less samsung specific also myscript's mobile notes app if you want to write a lot and then convert to text artflow studio raster and scribmaster vector are better drawing apps than sketchbook pro in my opinion but a free version galaxy edition is bundled i love being able to write 2 x to 3 x as much in stylus beta as my note 8 could plus there is a samsung feature that lets you pop up a handwriting to text window over any text field useful if you prefer a custo keyboard app like swiftkey or google keyboard samsung keyboard dock has a microusb 3.0 port for charging so you can use the same charger as the tablet or a regular microusb 2 no need to carry two chargers at this size you get a comfortable and full keyboard sans numpad home/enter/etc clusters use fn+arrows for home/end/page up/page down it's more comfortable than a 10.1&#34 like the asus transformer line because no compromises for size were necessary the kickstand/slot design fits my galaxy_note pro 12.2 galaxy_note 8.0 and my phone just fine i would like if the keyboard was a bit 34;thicker&#34 like my logitech k810 bluetooth keyboard or if it had the same 3-device easy switch but it does not thicker would be a better typing experience but we all know why they made the dock keyboard thin at least it is nice and clicky a decent laptop keyboard using a mouse has improved somewhat we now can have the full awesomeness of mouse hover working roughly the same as stylus hover air view there seems to be independent settings for turning it on/off for mouse and stylus works fine with the cheap motorola bluetooth mouse i got off of daily steals sadly we still can't mouse over on xkcd but stuff like the menu on amazon works usb ethernet dongles work for me this is a huge win for using the device at work samsung makes an expensive ethernet+2 port usb2 adapter i use the usb 2 ethernet dongle from my old first gen zenbook ux31 dunno if usb 3 gigabit dongles would work but i assume so as much as i love my galaxy_note 8.0 as a daily driver supporting ethernet makes the galaxy_note pro 12.2 a much better device for use at my work place where wi-fi is not always universal.cons extremely expensive 749 for 64gb or 32gb+dock on amazon or 32gb no dock at best buy for almost as much after tax it's so big you may find it hard to use as a tablet rather without a desk i'd highly reccomend a case that can prop it up at a better typing angle or even a breffo spiderpodium keyboard docks from samsung and zagg are simple kickstand like docks not a clamshell like the asus transformer dock logitech and various cheap case manufacturers off case+keyboard options too i use the samsung dock it won't charge from any of my powered mhl 1.1 adapters for galaxy_s3  note 2  note 8 devices but it still puts out the video signal just fine perhaps a mhl 2.0 adapter for galaxy_s5  note 3 will work while android handles keyboard and mouse input very well developers do not test with these google in particular tends to break ctrl+arrow and mouse wheel support in their apps whenever custom views are used which in google and samsung apps are very often.neutral issues there are several preloaded apps like the nytimes netflix evernote and remote meeting stuff but many of samsung's usual touchwiz apps are not present you have to download them most people are not gonna miss apps like chaton you get a much more minimalist feature set than say a galaxy_s_phone but you usually keep good stuff like swipe to screen shot at 32gb the size of touchwiz is not a big issue you can still expect a good 22~23 gigs or more of storage space you can stick an epic sized microsd card in and get apps2sd writing to microsd or usb drives requires using the stock files app making apps use their own directories on the media e.g storage/$device/android/data/$packagename or rooting you can get usb otg 2 and 3 cables and plug in a bloody 1tb drive with more functionality than nexus devices have without root the latest version of android rarely matters anymore unless you are an obsessive compulsive all the real goodies are in google play services and related google magic most things that matter are apps which is good because samsung probably takes twice as long to update their tablets as they do phones this device costs so much and is niche enough that the custom rom scene at xda is dead battery life and charging times could be better if you're used to an older transformer that had a battery in the keyboard dock but it ought to easily last 6-8 hours of dependable use probably 2-3 days if you don't use the tablet heavily all day long you'll likely want to leave it charging overnight or from dinner until bed the back is a faux leather styled plastic like a galaxy_note 3 it feels like good plastic unlike the galaxy_s3 and nexus 5 also the tablet is so darn big you can easily ignore the fake stitchy look at the edges on the back you may or may not like the look but it's easy to ignore and feels fine in

      "i needed a laptop replacement and started with the asus tf701 the more i used the docked tf701 the more disappointed i was with both dock and tablet it is fast faster than my old windows 7 laptop but i was eventually dealing with crashes as well as the dock not responding and at one time it quit working altogether some tech savvy folk have returned their dock more than 5 times only to get another lemon i was specifically looking at the tf701/dock as a laptop replacement for windows but most people who had replaced their windows laptops with android told me go get a galaxy_note i didn't want to go down that road because samsung seems to be dominating the android hardware market i felt we needed a more level playing field as there was during the old pc-era with dell hp compaq and the other companies which built hardware for windows i tried an 850 windows 8 substitute for my old windows 7 laptop but it was rife with so many issues that i finally decided to stick with android and eventually caved in and bought the galaxy_tab 12.2 with the zagg keyboard/dock yes i looked at the ipad as well and realized this was not a point in my life for re-entering the mac-world boy was i surprised...what a machine samsung has nailed the first generation of windowing on android and we can all hope there will be many generations to follow the sm-p900 brings up a very complex excel spreadsheet in less than 5 seconds one which took my old windows laptop nearly a minute to open and it is just overall a phenomenal experience to use this well what can i call it i feel like something from the future which has fortuitously landed in my hands  you can write on the screen and then send the notes to email or wherever and so far the translation has been nearly always right the capabilities just go on and on...it is a laptop replacement and much much more this product showcases why samsung dominates android hardware though their software wrap on their tablet is a lot of bloat-ware stuff which just gets in the way because of that and the fact that the new leader of android at google has disabled external sd-access in kitkat 4.4.2 i had to root it as it looks like all of us will with any device which has an sd card in the future which we want to use as a disc drive unless standard access to external sd memory is reinstated but rooting was an easy 15 minute process in my case though one which voided the tablet's warranty if not unrooted before making a claim i installed the nova launcher as well anyway all said when i look up from interacting with this galaxy 12.2 tab while writing this review by speaking/handwriting/and a bit of typing i fully expected to see myself floating between solar systems in an advanced anti-gravity machine which is destined to take everyone who understands the power of the machine on an unprecedented adventure...it's the type of advance which makes one feel that way and it's a good feeling what a machine\n",
      "i originally owned a galaxy_note 10.1 2014 edition tablet and it worked great but i was hoping for something bigger so when this tablet was announced i was annoyed and overjoyed all at once annoyed because had samsung announced it sooner i would have not purchased the 10.1 2014 edition).i picked the lte version because it was easier for me to get it from verizon on a payment plan device payment plan only available in verizon stores not online).once i got it home and started to play with it i realized there would be a new learning curve for this tablet similar to the 10.1 2014 edition while the button placement is the same one of the buttons has been changed from 34;menu&#34 to 34;recent apps&#34 this is also the case on their newer phones starting with the galaxy_s5 that took some getting used to actually still getting used to it lol also the size was an adjustment as well as it is not as easy to hold as a 10.1&#34 tablet but you have to expect this since this is a bigger tablet not just the dimensions but the weight of the tablet is a noticeable difference from the 10.1&#34 finally this tablet comes with kitkat android 4.4.2 installed there are some differences with the previous versions most of the changes are under the hood but also some buttons have been given new names gps  location new looks location button looks like a location icon from google maps instead of the old gps lock symbol and some things have been moved or given a separate section of their own default applications is now it's own section).also if you do not have a galaxy_note 3 or a galaxy_s5 you will need to get used to the new micro usb 3.0 standard that samsung is using for this tablet and others devices going forward contrary to a previous review the charging port is not wider than every single other charger port used and you can still use older micro usb charging cables it will just perform slightly slower although i have found out that the performance hit can be offset if you use a charger that is rated higher than the oem charger which is 2.1a i tested this with a 2.4a charger that has a pre-attached micro usb 2.0 end).all that said i refer back to my title this tablet is a beast it handles almost everything i throw at it with no lag whatsoever the s-pen works great as well but i have never had any issues with the s-pen on any samsung phone or tablet to date the battery life is imo better than the 10.1 2014 before it received the kitkat update i usually don't use my 12.2 everyday so it can sit in my bag for a day or two unused and the battery will show a difference of maybe 5-6 over two days.verizon lte works great on it too usually i am getting around 30mbps down in and around chicago il).video playback is great on this as well i use several apps plex emit bubble upnp mx player etc and i have not had any issues with any of these.also i have confirmed that the sandisk 128gb microsd card does work without issues in this tablet.if you travel a lot and are looking for a external battery for this tablet look for one with that is at least twice the capacity of the internal battery 9,500mah it will most likely only charge the tablet once if it's just twice the capacity but it should still work.overall even with the learning curve i really enjoy this tablet and i definitely recommend it if a bigger-sized tablet is what you are looking for\n",
      "the samsung galaxy_note pro is my 5th tablet and of course the largest one i've ever had this beast is almost twice the size of my last tablet the 7&#34 google nexus 7 with this size tablet you need a lot of power and it comes with it with the samsung exynos 5 octa processor the world's first arm based octa-core mobile cpu and a qualcomm snapdragon 800 msm8974 2.30 ghz quad core processor the performance is stellar though i do get a bit of lag in heavy multimedia use.i have the verizon 32gb black version so this processor is different than you get in the wi-fi only version the wi-fi only processor is the exynos 5400 1.9 ghz.the huge 12.2 inch screen is just gorgeous with a very high 2560x1600 resolution it's beautiful watching netflix or hbo to go is an amazing experience what i really like about the display is that you can view it at almost any angle so if more than one person is watching you can still enjoy the view.dual speakers are nice and solid with very little 34;tinny&#34 noise but overall not super powerful i usually hook my bluetooth speakers up if i need a little more sound i do love the fact you get 2 stereo speakers that does make movie watching a better experience.one of the reasons i picked this tablet is that it's a samsung unlike some i actually love the samsung touchwiz loader page i have it on my samsung galaxy_s4 phone and i love all the dozens of options that allow you to set up your device the way you want it when i had the nexus 7 i found myself really missing those options with that said on the galaxy_note pro 12.2 you're forced to use samsung&#8217;s version of flipboard called magazine ux after a few hours of using it i found it not very functional or useful there are a limited number of programs that works with it and you can't seem to get things like facebook to work on it it's too bad there isn't a way to remove that option because for me it's a useless tool.one really nice thing is that the galaxy_note pro came with the latest android os the kit kat 4.4.because this tablet is designed with business people in mind it comes with a slew of productivity software including a year of business week  samsung meeting samsung know and samsung e-meeting software installed.a little bit more about the hardware it comes with an 8mp camera on the rear and a 2mp camera for selfies on the front it also has 1080p video capability the camera works pretty nice for a tablet though i can't see myself using it much just because of the size of the tablet but it's there and works great i love that not only do i get 32gb of internal storage but it comes with a microsd slot which allows up to 64gb of additional storage that makes for a lot of music and videos.the battery life for a tablet this size is excellent it comes with a non-removable 9,500mah battery i get about 12 hours of steady usage out of it maybe 10 on heavier usage even though this unit comes with a usb 3.0 charger it takes a pretty long time to charge this size battery i suggest purchasing a usb 3.0 car charger for those road trips.because this is the note pro version of the tablet it comes with a decent but not great s-pen stylus and software but i won't get into this too much in this review.i could get into many more details of the tablet but i think you get the idea this tablet is a powerful and well built device with a ton of power and with the samsung touch wiz you have a lot of options to configure this device.pros:huge 12.2 screenfast qualcomm snapdragon 800 msm8974 2.30 ghzsamsung exynos 5 octa processorexternal storagelong battery lifeeasy multitaskingdecent front and rear camerasconsit's hugeexpensivejust ok styluscharging is fairly slow because of large battery\n",
      "if you have a samsung phone or specifically the galaxy_note 3 this review info is for you i purchased my note 3 through the verizon booth at my local costco late march 14 just recently i realized that for under 20 i could add 32gigs of memory to the already 32gig internal memory of the android phone and since i have about 11 gigs of music plus photo files moving through the phone moving all that to the add-on memory slot was a very attractive option.just about two weeks ago i bought the sandisk 32gig micro sd card when i put it into the phone there was a huge issue both formatting mounting and then getting the phone to recognize the card the card functioned fully in my pc frustratingly the card failed in my phone or so i thought i googled sandisk and found a couple 34;sandisk forums&#34 where others both here in the us and europe had been having 34;failed sandisk micro sd cards.&#34 even sandisk acknowledged the issue in late 2013 and offered a 34;programmed patch&#34 if you'd return the card to them i opted to just buy another card but not sandisk and then i saw amazon had this same size samsung card for the same low price this card was 17 when i bought it now it's 19 regardless i felt having a samsung card would eliminate the 34;card-blame-game&#34 and insure all would be ok.bottom line when the samsung card came in i had all the same problems after working with a verizon tier-2 tech she and i both realized that it 34;.....never was either the sandisk card or this samsung card.....&#34 but it was probably my relatively new phone and she further figured that the internal card slot just above the sim card slot was to blame/defective she-was-right she ordered a new phone for me it came in only two days later and as soon as i reprogrammed the new phone it immediately took my card and recognized it and was accepting all 11gigs of my music along with photos so if you're a samsung phone user and had an issue with the micro sd card remember that you could have a defective phone it may not be the card.as for the samsung card itself i can only say that while i didn't do any quantitative speed testing it's certainly fast enough for my music and photo needs i'm also a photographer combat photo in vietnam and should add that since going digital years ago and when an option went primarily with sandisk memory devices in my cameras and backup cases this would be the first time i've 34;gone off the reservation&#34 and purchased other than sandisk this being the samsung branded card but unique to me the chain is only as strong as the weakest link and i honestly don't need the speed when shooting commercial photos/catalog shots and because of my subject matter it's not like i'm trying to 34;stop-motion&#34 a 34;280 pound cast bronze plaque.&#34 unless the mounting studs all shear off at the same time and it's falling off of a university wall  just a fantasy scenario to reinforce my point ironically i'm seeing 32 gig cards at under 20 while 64 gig cards are just under 50 i'm predicting that soon 64 gig cards will be 34;way cheap.&#34 right now i'm believing that the 32 gig cards are a very good value if that's all you need btw when i do capture photos or videos on the phone non-critical shots for convenience i still transfer everything 34;same day&#34 to the pc for cataloging and/or processing\n",
      "you don't need such a fast micro ssd for your phone but i don't mind buying the best this worked well on the samsung galaxy_note ii and i recommend it if you are thinking about buying it\n",

      "this quick little card is working great in my galaxy_note 8.0  i've found that i need to get the 64gb version as i've already filled it up with movies and music\n",
      "this microsdxc card has tons of capacity and great read/write speeds i get write speeds from a usb 2.0 connection of more than 30mb a second when writing files of about 15-30mb in size the included adapter is pretty standard and will let you use the card in cameras that require a standard sd card samsung is a renowned manufacturer of memory and this product holds up their reputation i'm using it in a galaxy_note 3 and it's doing a great job recommended\n",
      "finally received my samsung chromebook 2 11.6 version jet black color and have had a day to get it set up mess around with it and compare it to myacer c720 chromebook 2gb as well as my previous experiences with the originalsamsung chromebookthat was released back in 2012 my initial up front experience is that i am overall very satisfied with the improvements that samsung has made there are some areas i wish they improved but overall for the price this is an outstanding way to experience the chrome os i'll touch on a few of my in-depth thoughts below and i'll update this all in the future as i have more experience with the device i'm going to focus more on the hardware and less on the operating system or software since the os will remain fairly consistent across all chromebook devices and plenty of information already exists about chrome os online:design/materials/build quality as mentioned above i went with the jet black version this new chromebook 2 features samsungs stitched leather design to the outside of the top shell similar to what you see if you have ever used their galaxy_note 3 it stands out a lot more when you see it spread across a much larger device like this i'm going to be honest i think some people are going to find this slightly tacky looking/feeling especially the fake stitching around the edges but personally i am a much bigger fan of it than i thought for a computing device in this price range you cannot really expect them to be able to throw on a full aluminum/metal case like you might find on a macbook pro or a higher end ultrabook laptop you're going to get something that is plastic or a more cost effective material and honestly i kind of like the way that this faux-leather design makes it stand out from other devices and the overall build quality of the chromebook 2 feels much improved over the original it doesn't have as much flex to it and even though it is still almost entirely plastic-based it certainly feels like a step up also compared to my acer c720 side by side the samsung cb2 feels significantly higher in quality.display my chromebook 2 is the 11.6 model this is one of the very few areas where i am finding myself wishing that samsung would have improved this new model even if it came at a slight cost increase the resolution on the 11.6 model is only 1366x768 which is the same as you'll find on pretty much every other chromebook aside from the pixel which is way too expensive and the upcoming 13 version of the chromebook 2 which will more to a full hd 1920 screen i'm actually ok with the resolution topping out at only 1366x768 on a screen of this size but they are still using a tn-based panel when i think that they should have stepped it up to an ips panel and really made it stand out it's about on par with the screen on my acer c720 doesn't feel like much of an improvement i wouldn't consider myself too overly picky but side by side with a device with an ips panel and the screen on the chromebook 2 just looks kind of dull and washed out in comparison according to the specs i've seen even the 13 version of the chromebook 2 is going to have a tn panel just in higher resolution so i wouldn't be surprised to hear more people complaining about this aspect.processor/ram the chromebook 2 utilizes one of samsung's own arm-based chips called the exynos 5 octa 5420 which is rated at 1.9ghz most of the computing experiences in my life outside of smartphone use have been with either an intel or an amd processor even my trusty acer c720 chromebook uses an intel celeron-based processor i was a little hesitant to make the jump to a newer generation of chromebook without an intel processor since i know acer is going to soon release a variant of the c720 with an intel i3 chip however so far i am quite impressed with how quick this exynos 5 octa chip has felt through normal use i haven't run any actual benchmarking programs or applications if someone has a suggestion i'll be glad to try one if they even exist for chrome os but directly comparing it side-by-side to the acer c720 running on the 1.4ghz celeron processor this is no comparison apps load much more instantly on the new chromebook 2 but the biggest difference can be seen when using anything that involves video doing a google hangout on my older chromebook was always slightly laggy enough that it was moderately frustrating especially when trying to multi-task during a hangout that lag has seemingly disappeared with this new model and in all honesty i haven't found a task yet where i've been wishing that it was faster than it is now this may also partially be aided by the fact that the chromebook 2 has 4gb of ram versus my acer c720 which only has 2gb and my previous experiences with the original chromebook 1 which also only had 2gb either way the improvement in speed has been fantastic and you will certainly notice it.keyboard/touchpad this is one of the most important things to me on any computing device i own nothing is more frustrating than a keyboard with a weird design or layout that becomes a permanent hassle for the life of the device luckily this might be the best overall feature of the chromebook 2 normally when i get a new device i find myself needing a period of adjustment as i get used to the feel of a new keyboard new keys new layout i found myself instantly loving the feel and use of the keyboard on the chromebook 2 the keys feel sturdy and solid and the spacing feels very natural between keys the keys themselves have a very natural curved feel to the top of them that yields a very pleasant typing experience honestly the best possible comment that i think i can give an input device is that it feels so natural and correct that you immediately stop thinking about it once you start using it and that is the case here i didn't have many complaints about the keyboard on my acer c720 but i can definitely say that the keyboard on this chromebook 2 is noticeably improved and samsung did a great job here the touchpad itself is pleasantly wide wider than the spacebar and feels accurate and smooth overall i can say without a doubt that this is the best keyboard and touchpad i've used on any chromebook device to date outside of the pixel.hard drive/storage my 11.6 chromebook 2 came with a 16gb solid-state hard drive only a little over half of which is actually accessible by the user to use as storage everyone has different needs so opinions will vary on this but one of the main draws of google os and the chromebooks are how well they function as cloud devices other than space used to install apps which for the most part are very small 20mb or less in size almost everything else i use my chromebooks for can be performed from the cloud or require very little onboard storage there are many options available to store files pictures data on the cloud google drive dropbox etc so i honestly don't think the storage space is going to be much of an issue for most people plus being that it is a solid-state drive it is very fast compared to traditional hard drives in terms of accessing files and data also since solid state drives have no moving parts inside a lot more stable and damage proof for lugging it around on-the-go unless you are going to be installing literally hundreds of apps most people probably only regularly use two dozen or less or unless you regularly need to work where you have no internet access at all for extended periods of time i think the size of the drive will suffice.battery this is a section i will need to update further in the future samsung is claiming 8 hours of battery life on a full charge i haven't noticed anything yet that would lead me to believe this claim is false but i also haven't owned it long enough to go through a full charge from start to finish i'll update my thoughts on this after i have run a few full cycles through the battery.speakers i'll be honest i don't personally use the built-in speakers a ton on any laptop or device i've owned i'm typically either just using this for web browsing or productivity but when i do listen to music with it i've found myself using bluetooth to connect to external bluetooth speakers in the past namely my logitech boombox or my jawbone jambox if i am on the go i did test the speakers out for a while though on my chromebook 2 and i have to say i am fairly impressed considering that the speakers are located on the bottom of the device i was surprised at how well they projected sound and considering their tiny size they were able to get louder than i expected while remaining fairly clear i wouldn't expect booming base from these but they don't sound tinny either and have a decent balance to them i'll still probably stick to using my bluetooth speakers when i want to blast music around my house or when working outdoors but i can't see the built-in speakers disappointing anyone who came in with reasonable expectations.other features i'll come back to this and add to my review once i have had more time with the unit webcam software pictures any other likes or dislikes that i find as i continue to use it further beyond the first few days.overall this is a great product especially when you factor in the value that you get for the money if i could give it partial stars i'd give it about a 4.6/5 and the only deduction would really be because i wish they had upgraded the screen further it's very very quick in everyday use boots up almost instantly from sleep or about 10 total seconds if you shut it off completely gets very solid battery life and chromeos allows you to easily do almost any normal computing task that you would normally do with apple os or windows it's very lightweight and portable and the build quality is solid if you come in expecting this to perform like a 1000 i7 ultrabook or a macbook pro you might leave disappointed but other than that especially at a price point of just over 300 at launch i feel like the chromebook 2 is not only going to sell a lot of new customers on the chrome os but offer a very noticeable speed and function upgrade to people who are using previous generation chromebook models if you have only used traditional laptops your whole life and this is your first experience into chrome os your mind is going to be blown when you first realize that you are instantly at the desktop and ready to go when you open the laptop up from sleep mode i will revisit my review and update it further as time passes and i notice new things to comment on anything you want me to review that i missed let me know in the comments and i'll come back and add my thoughts\n",
      "samsung has done it again they are releasing tablets at very periodic intervals samsung's fourth generation of galaxy_tab series is as expected and for this price point phenomenal i have been using galaxy_tab 2 and 3 and i am very much impressed with galaxy line of devices in my opinion 8&#34 is the maximum value for the money and features and hence i gave 8&#34 a 5 star if you are looking for playing games/reading books 10.1&#8221 is good i really wish this had a better resolution hence only 4 stars for pixels per density for this tablet.samsung has introduced 7&#34 8&#34 and 10.1&#34

the pro series just for one thing  resolution i was really hoping the tab series will go to a larger resolution but again price/performance is a factor that drives samsung to make devices at all ranges.let's start off with salient points of all of the galaxy_tab 4 series i will later compare with the previous tab 3 models i have also listed brief specs of current leading tablets at the very end if you would like to really compare and shop if you have tab 3 don&#8217;t upgrade no need to those devices worked well a year back and still are the photos look just as beautiful on them as they did a year ago!some tab 4 specs have certainly become better but not in a revolutionary sense the pixels per inch ppi is the best in 7&#8221 among all of galaxy_tab 4 series that is because all have same resolution and size is the variable for a first time user you will be blown away by the feature set now the tablets have multi user profiles so each user can customize like a home pc.look at three specs that really interest you and nail down the tablet you need look at the big picture what you want from a tablet now a year from now what your family needs out of this and make a

      "pros-1 gorgeous display.2 slim and light great portability.3 very fast good performance.4 good battery life.5 fingerprint sensor.6 micro sd card support up to 128 gb.cons-1 the tablet comes with a lot of bloatware.2 no s pen support.3 camera is mediocre.i have managed to get my hands into the samsung galaxy_tab s 8.4 for the last couple of weeks i was very excited to give it a try when i saw the samsung announcement i have to say after a trying it out for some time i can honestly say i am impressed below i will give you my thoughts on the tablet.pros-1 by far the most compelling reason to buy this tablet is the display it looks really amazing it has top of the line resolution of 2560 x 1600 giving it 359 pixels per inch but it is not the resolution that makes the display so unique but the super amoled technology that creates bigger contrast in colors colors look saturated and slightly unrealistic but there is no denying they look great at the end i think it is a matter of preference if you like the display of the samsung galaxy_s5 then you will certainly like the display of the tablet you can tell samsung made this particular tablet for content consumption everything from pictures videos to magazines look very impressive.during sunlight exposure the display has to be cranked up almost all the way up for you to read comfortably i noticed that videos look better in direct sunlight that previous samsung tablets i have used i put my samsung galaxy_note 10.1 2012 model tablet side by side and it just pales in comparison.2 this tablet is one of the thinnest and lightest tablets in the market it is even lighter than the ipad retina mini and that is certainly saying a lot in terms of weight it easily rivals 7 inch tablets it weight the same as the nexus 7 2013 keep in mind the nexus 7 screen is only 7 inches as opposed the tab s 8.4 inch display i can easily hold the tablet one handed for extended periods of time in terms of weight it is as close to the amazon kindle e-reader as i experienced as far as the outside of the tablet is concerned it is made of the exact material and texture of the samsung galaxy_s5 it is plastic but it has a soft very comfortable dimple back that does not collect fingerprint not as nice looking as the ipad but a great improvement from previous generations besides that plastic back is what allows the tablet to keep the weight down.3 the samsung galaxy_tab s 8.4 is considered a high end tablet and it has the specs to back it up the wifi model that i have been using has a samsung made exynos 5 octa core processor four of the cores are running at 1.9 ghz and four cores running at 1.3 ghz it also comes with 3 gb of ram memory what does this all mean that it can handle just about everything you can throw at it and more the processor in this tablet is designed for optimum performance in my time using the tablet i have not discovered any slow down at all multitasking works incredible well the only thing i did not like was the samsung keyboard i personally do not use it because it tends to lag instead i installed the google keyboard it performs much smoother the rest of the interface however is fluid and smooth games open very fast and browser performance is better than ever i have absolutely no complaints when it comes to performance.4 the battery in the tablet has a capacity of 4900 mah samsung claims that the battery life is for 10 hours of web use on a typical day after using it to catch up on morning news listening to some music a couple hours of netflix and youtube i still go to bed with around 40-50 battery that is with the brightness at a little less than half one day i was reading outside and decided to crank up the brightness all the way up i lost about 20 in an hour games also tend to use the battery faster but that is to be expected for normal everyday use you should have no problem getting through your day with it.5 android has a lot of different locking method for your devices i feel that other than a long password the safest way to lock your device is by fingerprint the fingerprint scanner in this tablet is the same model found on the galaxy_s5 you have to swipe your finger across it as opposed to the one in the iphone 5s where you only have to place your finger and it unlocks itself i found the fingerprint scanner to be more accurate than the one on the s5 you still have to be careful how you swipe the finger but it fails less often than on the galaxy_s5 you have the option of using several fingers to unlock the device that way more than one person has access to the tablet at all times.6 the tablet supports micro sd cards up to 128 gb in capacity this is great because the tablet itself only comes with 16 gb of storage built in which is lacking in today&#8217;s world i myself use a 64 gb card with the tablet and there i have been able to store over 10 movies over 1000 songs and a few hundred family pictures the micro sd cards now a day are cheaper than ever and they provide so much flexibility it is a real convenience and i am glad samsung has decided to support its use for so long.cons-1 if you have ever used a samsung galaxy phone in the past you know they usually come with a lot of prepackaged apps that is not the exception here it comes with a ton of samsung apps the vast majority of them i have not even touched until this day.2 one of the things that bummed me out a little bit about this tablet is that it doesn&#8217;t support the s pen the s pen is useful to take notes and to make drawings and it has been a staple of samsung tablets over the last couple of years i have a feeling they did not included because the s pen might not be compatible with the super amoled screen.3 you can clearly tell that manufacturers just don&#8217;t place much emphasis on the camera for tablets even though the galaxy_tab s is a premium tablet the camera looks more like one found in a mid-range phone the camera on the back is 8 mp that is above average for tablets but is not really anything that will impress you at this point photos in good sunlight came out fairly good indoors and at night the pictures looked grainy and you had to be really still for them not to get blurry the same performance was seen during videos the camera has no image stabilization therefore you have to have a very steady hand or else the video looks very shaky i can&#8217;t really say i am going to be using it much the front facing camera is 2.1 mp and it performs as well as you could hope for it is all right for the occasional skype call but nothing too spectacular it is average.overall do i recommend this tablet i whole heartedly do especially if you are looking to use it for entertainment and media consumption the display is fantastic for movies pictures and reading the design of the tablet itself is very thin light and comfortable to use in terms of overall size and weight the tablet is rivaling the 7 inch models from last year the exclusion of the s pen makes this tablet not the best in terms of productivity if you are looking for productivity on a tablet maybe the samsung note series might be a better option for you.i hope this review was useful and i will be looking to update it in the coming weeks.if you are still unsure whether to purchase this tablet go to a local retail store and see for yourself compare it side by side with other tablets once you take a look at the display and the overall aesthetic i promise you will be impressed\n",
